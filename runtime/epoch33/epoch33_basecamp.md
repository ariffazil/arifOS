# ArifOS Epoch 33Ω · Basecamp Lock Runtime

This directory describes the **governed runtime** for *ArifOS v33Ω (Basecamp Lock)*.

Epoch 33Ω is the **Deployment Era**:
- No new physics, no new subsystems.
- Only refinement, consolidation, validation, and externalisation of the existing canon.
- All cognition is measured, cooled, and sealed via the Cooling Ledger and Vault-999.

The authoritative runtime spec is in **`epoch33_runtime.yaml`**.

## 1. What Epoch 33Ω Means

**Conceptual state:**

- APEX, TAC, TEARFRAME, TPCP, @EYE, AAA (AGI·ASI·APEX PRIME) and W@W organs
  (@RIF, @WELL, @WEALTH, @PROMPT, @GEOX) are *final*.
- Tri-Witness (Human · AI · Earth) is hardened to use the geometric mean and is extended
  to **Quad-Witness** by insisting on a valid, idempotent ledger receipt for every
  governed act.
- TUQs (Thermodynamic Unknown Questions) verify **application**, not invent new theory.
- Dream Engine edits existing laws; it no longer introduces new frameworks.

In short: the **engine is built**. Epoch 33Ω is about **using it responsibly** and
making it legible to others (labs, regulators, reviewers).
