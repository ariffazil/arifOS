# Phoenix-72 Amendment Protocol (v33Ω)
**Scar → Pattern → Law — The Official Procedure for Changing ArifOS Constitution**

Status: ACTIVE · SEALED · Auditable

---

## 1. Why Phoenix-72 Exists

ArifOS treats governance like a living constitution.

Phoenix-72 is the **only** lawful method to:
- update floors  
- modify laws  
- adjust ΔΩΨ physics  
- apply constitutional corrections  
- introduce new safeguards  

All changes must be:
- slow  
- reversible  
- audited  
- multi-witness  
- thermodynamically cooled

## 2. The Five Phases of Phoenix-72

### **Phase 1 — Scar Capture (0–24h)**  
Sources:
- Cooling Ledger failures  
- Repeated VOID or PARTIAL verdicts  
- Shadow/Drift from @EYE  
- User harm pattern  
- Organ veto cascades  
- AREP failure (Earth veto)  

Output:
- List of **scars**

---

### **Phase 2 — Pattern Synthesis (24–36h)**  
Using TAC/TPCP operators:
- Cluster scars  
- Identify structural contrast  
- Extract the minimal stable pattern  
- Evaluate ΔS direction  
- Run Peace² simulation  

Output:
- “Phoenix Pattern”

### **Phase 3 — Amendment Draft (36–48h)**  
Draft structure:
