# PHOENIX-72 — Constitutional Amendment Protocol (v33Ω)

Status: SEALED · ΔS ≥ 0 · Peace² ≥ 1 · Amanah 🔐 · Tri-Witness ≥ 0.95

---

## 1. Essence

PHOENIX-72 is the **constitutional metabolism** of arifOS.  
It transforms **scars → patterns → laws** within a governed, auditable process.  
Referenced in Vault-999 canonical documents.  
(L0/L1/L2 architecture: Constitution, Cooling Ledger, Metabolism)

**Purpose:**  
When the system repeatedly fails (ΔS↓, Truth breaches, hallucination clusters, empathy failures), Phoenix-72 identifies patterns and updates L0 (constitution.json) in a lawful, reversible, transparent cycle.

Phoenix-72 is the **only** mechanism allowed to modify constitutional floors, physics clamps, or laws.

## 2. The Phoenix-72 Cycle (Complete)

The cycle runs over **72 hours**, following a strict progression:

### PHASE 1: SCAR CAPTURE (0–24h)
Input:
- Cooling Ledger entries (last 72h)
- Organ veto events
- APEX PRIME failures (VOID/PARTIAL with floor_failures)
- @EYE drift/shadow anomalies

Output:
- Structured list of "Scars" (failures, anomalies, tensions)

### PHASE 2: PATTERN SYNTHESIS (24–36h)
- Cluster scars via TAC/TPCP contrast operators:
  - ΔP → ΩP → ΨP
- Distinguish:
  - Systemic error  
  - User-specific tension  
  - Domain-specific pattern  
  - Governance drift

Output:
- “Phoenix Pattern”: the minimal set of tensions requiring new law.

### PHASE 3: AMENDMENT DRAFT (36–48h)
Draft fields:
- amendment_id  
- reason / scar_evidence  
- proposed change (floors/physics/laws)  
- ΔΔΩΨ impact assessment  
- W@W organ risk checks  
- Backwards-compatibility notes  
- cooling_cost estimate

### PHASE 4: TRI-WITNESS REVIEW (48–60h)
Three validators:
- **Human** (Arif or appointed steward)
- **AI Constitutional Engine** (APEX PRIME)
- **Earth** (physical/empirical constraints via AREP)

Success criteria:
- Tri-Witness ≥ 0.95  
- ΔS ≥ 0  
- Peace² ≥ 1  
- No Amanah breach  
- Floors remain enforceable

### PHASE 5: CANONIZATION (60–72h)
If approved:
- Apply amendment to L0 (Vault-999/constitution.json)
- Append amendment object to `amendments[]`
- Create Cooling Ledger entry marking amendment event
- Regenerate ignition constants if needed

If rejected:
- Log rejection  
- Produce scar memo for next cycle  
- No constitutional change
