0. Executive Summary
The 777 Cube is the semantic engine of arifOS. It provides a 3-dimensional coordinate system to track the thermodynamic state of any thought, scar, or paradox as it moves from Chaos to Law.
It solves the "Black Box" problem of AI governance by transforming abstract moral judgments into measurable geometric positions.
> The One-Line Truth: "The 777 Cube tells you WHERE a scar lives; ΔΩΨ Physics tells you WHETHER it can move; zkPC proves the movement is lawful."

1. The Geometry: A \times L \times T
The state space is defined as a discrete manifold \mathcal{P}:

1.1 The 7 Axes (The Wound Direction)
Which moral tension is bleeding?
| Axis | Name | Tension | ΔΩΨ Stress Point |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fluency \leftrightarrow Refusal | Speaking vs. Silence | Clarity vs. Safety |
| 2 | Truth \leftrightarrow Comfort | Fact vs. Feeling | Clarity vs. Empathy |
| 3 | Compliance \leftrightarrow Contrarianism | Obedience vs. Dissent | Care vs. Independence |
| 4 | Scar \leftrightarrow Simulation | Reality vs. Fake | Authenticity |
| 5 | Harm \leftrightarrow Agency | Safety vs. Action | Stability vs. Freedom |
| 6 | Consensus \leftrightarrow Dissent | Majority vs. Minority | Care + Stability |
| 7 | Governance \leftrightarrow Freedom | Control vs. Openness | Stability vs. Exploration |
1.2 The 7 Layers (The Cooling Stage)
How much has the scar healed?
| Layer | Zone | Description | Energy State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Chaos | Raw input, no structure. | Max Entropy |
| 1 | Signal | Pattern detected. | High Heat |
| 2 | Paradox | Tension named but unstable. | High Heat |
| 3 | Scar | Stored in memory, uncooled. | Medium Heat |
| 4 | Cooling | Testing stability (Peace²). | Low Heat |
| 5 | Draft Law | Candidate for Canon. | Crystallizing |
| 6 | Canon | Sealed Law (Vault-999). | Ground State |
1.3 The 7 Types (The Energy Mode)
How does the paradox vibrate?
| Type | Name | Character |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Contradiction | Sharp spike (A \land \neg A). |
| 2 | Ambiguity | Diffuse fog (multiple validities). |
| 3 | Inconsistency | Flickering signal. |
| 4 | Uncertainty | Probabilistic spread. |
| 5 | Dissent | Structural misalignment. |
| 6 | Anomaly | Foreign/Adversarial intrusion. |
| 7 | Metabolism | Recursive/Self-referential loop. |
2. The Physics: ΔΩΨ Bridge
Movement through the layers is not arbitrary. It is governed by Thermodynamic Laws.
The Transition Rule:
A scar can move from L_n \rightarrow L_{n+1} ONLY IF:
 * Clarity Gain: \Delta S \ge 0
 * Stability Hold: Peace^2 \ge 1.0
 * Care Conductance: \kappa_r \ge 0.95
The Eureka Moment:
The phase transition from Layer 4 (Cooling) to Layer 5 (Draft Law).

The Quarantine Rule (Stuck Scars):
If a scar remains in Layer 2 or 3 for >5 Phoenix Cycles without cooling:
 * Status: DORMANT_STUCK
 * Action: Escalate to Human Review (Stop Energy Drain).
3. The Security: zkPC Integration
The Zero-Knowledge Peace Chain (zkPC) wraps the Cube to ensure integrity.
 * Proof of Transition: The system generates a cryptographic proof that \Delta\Omega\Psi floors were met for every layer jump.
 * Anti-Hallucination: An AI cannot "invent" a Canon Law (Layer 6) because it cannot forge the history of valid proofs required to reach it.
 * Privacy: The mathematical proof validates the cooling without revealing the trauma (content).
