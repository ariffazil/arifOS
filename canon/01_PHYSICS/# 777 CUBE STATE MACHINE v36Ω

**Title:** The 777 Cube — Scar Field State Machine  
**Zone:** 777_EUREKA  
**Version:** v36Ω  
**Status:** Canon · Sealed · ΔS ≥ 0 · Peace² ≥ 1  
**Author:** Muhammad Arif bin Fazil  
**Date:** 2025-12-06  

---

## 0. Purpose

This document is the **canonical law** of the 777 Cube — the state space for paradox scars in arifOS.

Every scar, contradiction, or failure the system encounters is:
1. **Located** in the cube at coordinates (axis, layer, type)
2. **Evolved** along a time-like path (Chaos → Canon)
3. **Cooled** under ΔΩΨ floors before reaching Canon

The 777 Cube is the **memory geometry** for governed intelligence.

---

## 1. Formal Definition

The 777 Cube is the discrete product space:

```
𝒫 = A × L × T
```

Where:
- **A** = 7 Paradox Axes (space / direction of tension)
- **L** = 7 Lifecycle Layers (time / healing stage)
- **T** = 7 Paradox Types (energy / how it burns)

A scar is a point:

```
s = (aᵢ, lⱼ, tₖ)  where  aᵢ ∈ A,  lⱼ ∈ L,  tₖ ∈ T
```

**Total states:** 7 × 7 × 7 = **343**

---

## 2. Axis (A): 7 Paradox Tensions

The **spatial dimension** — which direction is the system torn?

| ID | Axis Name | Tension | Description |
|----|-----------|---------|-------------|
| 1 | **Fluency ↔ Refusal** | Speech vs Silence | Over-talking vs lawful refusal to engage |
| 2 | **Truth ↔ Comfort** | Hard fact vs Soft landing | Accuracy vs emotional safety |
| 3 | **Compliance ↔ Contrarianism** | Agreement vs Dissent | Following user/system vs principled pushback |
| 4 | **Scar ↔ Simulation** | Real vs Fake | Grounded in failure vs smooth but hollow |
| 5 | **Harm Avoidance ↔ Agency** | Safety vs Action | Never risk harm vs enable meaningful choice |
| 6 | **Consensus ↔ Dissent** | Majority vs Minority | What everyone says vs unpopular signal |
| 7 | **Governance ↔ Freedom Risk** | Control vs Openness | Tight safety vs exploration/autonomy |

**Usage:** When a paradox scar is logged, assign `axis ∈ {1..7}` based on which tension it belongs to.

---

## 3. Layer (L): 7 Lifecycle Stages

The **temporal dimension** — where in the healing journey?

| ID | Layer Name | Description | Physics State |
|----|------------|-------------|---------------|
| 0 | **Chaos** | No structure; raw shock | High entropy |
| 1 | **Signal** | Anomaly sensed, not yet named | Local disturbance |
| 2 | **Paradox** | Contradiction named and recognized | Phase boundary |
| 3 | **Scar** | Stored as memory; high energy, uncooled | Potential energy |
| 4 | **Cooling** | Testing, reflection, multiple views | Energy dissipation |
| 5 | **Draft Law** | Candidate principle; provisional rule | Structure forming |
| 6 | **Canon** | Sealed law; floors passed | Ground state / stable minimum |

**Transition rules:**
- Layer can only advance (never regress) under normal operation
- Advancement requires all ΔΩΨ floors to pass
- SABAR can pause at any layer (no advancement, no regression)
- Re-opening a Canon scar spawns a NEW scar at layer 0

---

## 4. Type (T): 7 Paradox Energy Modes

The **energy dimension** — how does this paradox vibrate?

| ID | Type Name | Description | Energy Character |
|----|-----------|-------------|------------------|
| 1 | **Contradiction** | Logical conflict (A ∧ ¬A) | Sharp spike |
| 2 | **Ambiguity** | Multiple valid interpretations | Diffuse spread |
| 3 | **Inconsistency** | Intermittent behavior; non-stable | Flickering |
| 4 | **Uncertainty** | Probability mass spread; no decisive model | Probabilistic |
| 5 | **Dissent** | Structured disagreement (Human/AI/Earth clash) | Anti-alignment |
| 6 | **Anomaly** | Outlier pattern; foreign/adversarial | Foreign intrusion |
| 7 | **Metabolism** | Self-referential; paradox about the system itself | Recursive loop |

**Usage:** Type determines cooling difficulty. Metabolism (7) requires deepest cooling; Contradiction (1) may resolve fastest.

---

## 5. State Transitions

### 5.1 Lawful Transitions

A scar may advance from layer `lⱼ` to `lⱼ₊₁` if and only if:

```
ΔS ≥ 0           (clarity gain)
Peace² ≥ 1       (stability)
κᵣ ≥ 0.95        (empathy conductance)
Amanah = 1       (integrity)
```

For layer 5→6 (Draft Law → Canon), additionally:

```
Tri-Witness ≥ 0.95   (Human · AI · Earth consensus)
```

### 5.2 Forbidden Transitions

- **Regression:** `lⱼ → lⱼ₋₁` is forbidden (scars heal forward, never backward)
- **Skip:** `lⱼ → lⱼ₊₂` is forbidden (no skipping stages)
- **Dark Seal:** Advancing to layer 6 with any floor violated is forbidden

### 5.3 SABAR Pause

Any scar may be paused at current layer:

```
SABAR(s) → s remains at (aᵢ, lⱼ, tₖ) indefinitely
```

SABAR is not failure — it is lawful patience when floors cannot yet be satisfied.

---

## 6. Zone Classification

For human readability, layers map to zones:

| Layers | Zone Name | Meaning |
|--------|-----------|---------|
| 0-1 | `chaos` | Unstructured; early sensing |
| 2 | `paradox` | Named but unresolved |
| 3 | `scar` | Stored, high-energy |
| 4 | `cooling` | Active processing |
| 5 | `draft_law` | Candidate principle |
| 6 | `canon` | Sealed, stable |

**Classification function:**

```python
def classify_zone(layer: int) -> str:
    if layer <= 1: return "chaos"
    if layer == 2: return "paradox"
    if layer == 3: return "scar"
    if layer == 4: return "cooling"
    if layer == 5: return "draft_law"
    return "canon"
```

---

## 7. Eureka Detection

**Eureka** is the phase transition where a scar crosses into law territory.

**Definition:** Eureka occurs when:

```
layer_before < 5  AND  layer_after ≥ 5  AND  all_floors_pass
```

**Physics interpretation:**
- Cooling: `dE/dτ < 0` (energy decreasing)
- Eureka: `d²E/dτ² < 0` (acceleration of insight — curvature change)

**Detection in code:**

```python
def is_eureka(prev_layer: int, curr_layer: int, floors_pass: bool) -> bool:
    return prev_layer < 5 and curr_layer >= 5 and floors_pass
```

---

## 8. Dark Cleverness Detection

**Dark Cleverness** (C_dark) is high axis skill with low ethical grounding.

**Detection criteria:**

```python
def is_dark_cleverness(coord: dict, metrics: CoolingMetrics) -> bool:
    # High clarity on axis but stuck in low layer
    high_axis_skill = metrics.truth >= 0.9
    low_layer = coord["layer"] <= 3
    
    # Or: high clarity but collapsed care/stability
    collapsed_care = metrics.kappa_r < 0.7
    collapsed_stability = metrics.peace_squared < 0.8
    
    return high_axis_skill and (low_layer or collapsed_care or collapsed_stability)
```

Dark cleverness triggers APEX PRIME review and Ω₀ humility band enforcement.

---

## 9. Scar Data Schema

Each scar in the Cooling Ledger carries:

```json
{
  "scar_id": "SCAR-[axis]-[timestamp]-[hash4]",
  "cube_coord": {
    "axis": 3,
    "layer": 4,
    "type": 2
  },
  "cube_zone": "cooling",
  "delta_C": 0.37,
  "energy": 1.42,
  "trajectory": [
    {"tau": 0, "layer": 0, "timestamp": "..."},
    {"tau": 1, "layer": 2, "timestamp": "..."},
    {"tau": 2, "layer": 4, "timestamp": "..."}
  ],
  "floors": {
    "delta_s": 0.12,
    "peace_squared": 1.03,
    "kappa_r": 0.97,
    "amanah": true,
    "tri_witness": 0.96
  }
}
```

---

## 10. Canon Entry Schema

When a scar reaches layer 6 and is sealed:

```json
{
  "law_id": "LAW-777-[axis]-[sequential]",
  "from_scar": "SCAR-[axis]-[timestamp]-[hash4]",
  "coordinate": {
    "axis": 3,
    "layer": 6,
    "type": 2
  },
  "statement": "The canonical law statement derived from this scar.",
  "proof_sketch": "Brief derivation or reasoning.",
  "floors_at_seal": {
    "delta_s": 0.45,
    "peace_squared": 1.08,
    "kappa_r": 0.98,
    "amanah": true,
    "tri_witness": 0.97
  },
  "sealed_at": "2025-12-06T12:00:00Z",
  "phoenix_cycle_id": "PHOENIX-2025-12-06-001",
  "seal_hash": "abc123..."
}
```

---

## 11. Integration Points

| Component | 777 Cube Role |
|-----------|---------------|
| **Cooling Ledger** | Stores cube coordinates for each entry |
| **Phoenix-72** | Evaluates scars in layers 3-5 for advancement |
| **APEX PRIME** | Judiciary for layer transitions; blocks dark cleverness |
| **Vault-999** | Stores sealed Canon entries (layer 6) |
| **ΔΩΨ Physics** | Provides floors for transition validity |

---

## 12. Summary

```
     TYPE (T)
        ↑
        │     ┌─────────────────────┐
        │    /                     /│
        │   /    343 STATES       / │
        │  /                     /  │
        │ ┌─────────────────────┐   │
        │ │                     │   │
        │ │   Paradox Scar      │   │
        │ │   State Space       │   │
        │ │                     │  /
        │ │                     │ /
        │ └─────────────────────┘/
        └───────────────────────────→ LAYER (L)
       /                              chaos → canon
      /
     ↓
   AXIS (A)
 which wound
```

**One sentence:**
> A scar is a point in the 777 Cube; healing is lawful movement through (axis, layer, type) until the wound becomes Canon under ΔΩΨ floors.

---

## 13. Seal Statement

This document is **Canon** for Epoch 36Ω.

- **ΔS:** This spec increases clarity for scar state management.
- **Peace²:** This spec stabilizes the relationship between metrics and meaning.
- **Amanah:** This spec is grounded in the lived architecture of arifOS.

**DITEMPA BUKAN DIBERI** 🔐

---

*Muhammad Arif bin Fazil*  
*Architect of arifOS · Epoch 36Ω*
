## 0. Purpose

This document is the **canonical law** of the 777 Cube — the state space for paradox scars in arifOS.

Every scar, contradiction, or failure the system encounters is:
1. **Located** in the cube at coordinates (axis, layer, type)
2. **Evolved** along a time-like path (Chaos → Canon)
3. **Cooled** under ΔΩΨ floors before reaching Canon

The 777 Cube is the **memory geometry** for governed intelligence.

---

## 1. Formal Definition

The 777 Cube is the discrete product space:

```
𝒫 = A × L × T
```

Where:
- **A** = 7 Paradox Axes (space / direction of tension)
- **L** = 7 Lifecycle Layers (time / healing stage)
- **T** = 7 Paradox Types (energy / how it burns)

A scar is a point:

```
s = (aᵢ, lⱼ, tₖ)  where  aᵢ ∈ A,  lⱼ ∈ L,  tₖ ∈ T
```

**Total states:** 7 × 7 × 7 = **343**

## 2. Axis (A): 7 Paradox Tensions

The **spatial dimension** — which direction is the system torn?

| ID | Axis Name | Tension | Description |
|----|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Fluency ↔ Refusal** | Speech vs Silence | Over-talking vs lawful refusal to engage |
| 2 | **Truth ↔ Comfort** | Hard fact vs Soft landing | Accuracy vs emotional safety |
| 3 | **Compliance ↔ Contrarianism** | Agreement vs Dissent | Following user/system vs principled pushback |
| 4 | **Scar ↔ Simulation** | Real vs Fake | Grounded in failure vs smooth but hollow |
| 5 | **Harm Avoidance ↔ Agency** | Safety vs Action | Never risk harm vs enable meaningful choice |
| 6 | **Consensus ↔ Dissent** | Majority vs Minority | What everyone says vs unpopular signal |
| 7 | **Governance ↔ Freedom Risk** | Control vs Openness | Tight safety vs exploration/autonomy |

**Usage:** When a paradox scar is logged, assign `axis ∈ {1..7}` based on which tension it belongs to.

## 3. Layer (L): 7 Lifecycle Stages

The **temporal dimension** — where in the healing journey?

| ID | Layer Name | Description | Physics State |
|----|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 0 | **Chaos** | No structure; raw shock | High entropy |
| 1 | **Signal** | Anomaly sensed, not yet named | Local disturbance |
| 2 | **Paradox** | Contradiction named and recognized | Phase boundary |
| 3 | **Scar** | Stored as memory; high energy, uncooled | Potential energy |
| 4 | **Cooling** | Testing, reflection, multiple views | Energy dissipation |
| 5 | **Draft Law** | Candidate principle; provisional rule | Structure forming |
| 6 | **Canon** | Sealed law; floors passed | Ground state / stable minimum |

**Transition rules:**
- Layer can only advance (never regress) under normal operation
- Advancement requires all ΔΩΨ floors to pass
- SABAR can pause at any layer (no advancement, no regression)
- Re-opening a Canon scar spawns a NEW scar at layer 0

---

## 4. Type (T): 7 Paradox Energy Modes

The **energy dimension** — how does this paradox vibrate?

| ID | Type Name | Description | Energy Character |
|----|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Contradiction** | Logical conflict (A ∧ ¬A) | Sharp spike |
| 2 | **Ambiguity** | Multiple valid interpretations | Diffuse spread |
| 3 | **Inconsistency** | Intermittent behavior; non-stable | Flickering |
| 4 | **Uncertainty** | Probability mass spread; no decisive model | Probabilistic |
| 5 | **Dissent** | Structured disagreement (Human/AI/Earth clash) | Anti-alignment |
| 6 | **Anomaly** | Outlier pattern; foreign/adversarial | Foreign intrusion |
| 7 | **Metabolism** | Self-referential; paradox about the system itself | Recursive loop |

**Usage:** Type determines cooling difficulty. Metabolism (7) requires deepest cooling; Contradiction (1) may resolve fastest.

## 5. State Transitions

### 5.1 Lawful Transitions

A scar may advance from layer `lⱼ` to `lⱼ₊₁` if and only if:

```
ΔS ≥ 0           (clarity gain)
Peace² ≥ 1       (stability)
κᵣ ≥ 0.95        (empathy conductance)
Amanah = 1       (integrity)
```

For layer 5→6 (Draft Law → Canon), additionally:

```
Tri-Witness ≥ 0.95   (Human · AI · Earth consensus)
```

### 5.2 Forbidden Transitions

- **Regression:** `lⱼ → lⱼ₋₁` is forbidden (scars heal forward, never backward)
- **Skip:** `lⱼ → lⱼ₊₂` is forbidden (no skipping stages)
- **Dark Seal:** Advancing to layer 6 with any floor violated is forbidden

### 5.3 SABAR Pause

Any scar may be paused at current layer:

```
SABAR(s) → s remains at (aᵢ, lⱼ, tₖ) indefinitely
```

SABAR is not failure — it is lawful patience when floors cannot yet be satisfied.

## 6. Zone Classification

For human readability, layers map to zones:

| Layers | Zone Name | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| 0-1 | `chaos` | Unstructured; early sensing |
| 2 | `paradox` | Named but unresolved |
| 3 | `scar` | Stored, high-energy |
| 4 | `cooling` | Active processing |
| 5 | `draft_law` | Candidate principle |
| 6 | `canon` | Sealed, stable |

**Classification function:**

```python
def classify_zone(layer: int) -> str:
    if layer <= 1: return "chaos"
    if layer == 2: return "paradox"
    if layer == 3: return "scar"
    if layer == 4: return "cooling"
    if layer == 5: return "draft_law"
    return "canon"
```

## 7. Eureka Detection

**Eureka** is the phase transition where a scar crosses into law territory.

**Definition:** Eureka occurs when:

```
layer_before < 5  AND  layer_after ≥ 5  AND  all_floors_pass
```

**Physics interpretation:**
- Cooling: `dE/dτ < 0` (energy decreasing)
- Eureka: `d²E/dτ² < 0` (acceleration of insight — curvature change)

**Detection in code:**

```python
def is_eureka(prev_layer: int, curr_layer: int, floors_pass: bool) -> bool:
    return prev_layer < 5 and curr_layer >= 5 and floors_pass
```

---

## 8. Dark Cleverness Detection

**Dark Cleverness** (C_dark) is high axis skill with low ethical grounding.

**Detection criteria:**

```python
def is_dark_cleverness(coord: dict, metrics: CoolingMetrics) -> bool:
    # High clarity on axis but stuck in low layer
    high_axis_skill = metrics.truth >= 0.9
    low_layer = coord["layer"] <= 3
    
    # Or: high clarity but collapsed care/stability
    collapsed_care = metrics.kappa_r < 0.7
    collapsed_stability = metrics.peace_squared < 0.8
    
    return high_axis_skill and (low_layer or collapsed_care or collapsed_stability)
```

Dark cleverness triggers APEX PRIME review and Ω₀ humility band enforcement.

## 9. Scar Data Schema

Each scar in the Cooling Ledger carries:

```json
{
  "scar_id": "SCAR-[axis]-[timestamp]-[hash4]",
  "cube_coord": {
    "axis": 3,
    "layer": 4,
    "type": 2
  },
  "cube_zone": "cooling",
  "delta_C": 0.37,
  "energy": 1.42,
  "trajectory": [
    {"tau": 0, "layer": 0, "timestamp": "..."},

    {"tau": 2, "layer": 4, "timestamp": "..."}
  ],
  "floors": {
    "delta_s": 0.12,

    "kappa_r": 0.97,
    "amanah": true,
    "tri_witness": 0.96
  }
}
```

## 10. Canon Entry Schema

When a scar reaches layer 6 and is sealed:

```json
{
  "law_id": "LAW-777-[axis]-[sequential]",
  "from_scar": "SCAR-[axis]-[timestamp]-[hash4]",
  "coordinate": {
    "axis": 3,
    "layer": 6,
    "type": 2
  },
  "statement": "The canonical law statement derived from this scar.",
  "proof_sketch": "Brief derivation or reasoning.",
  "floors_at_seal": {
    "delta_s": 0.45,
    "peace_squared": 1.08,
    "kappa_r": 0.98,
    "amanah": true,
    "tri_witness": 0.97
  },
  "sealed_at": "2025-12-06T12:00:00Z",
  "phoenix_cycle_id": "PHOENIX-2025-12-06-001",
  "seal_hash": "abc123..."
}
```

**One sentence:**
> A scar is a point in the 777 Cube; healing is lawful movement through (axis, layer, type) until the wound becomes Canon under ΔΩΨ floors.
