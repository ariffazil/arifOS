# ARIFOS CANON v35Ω — Unified Overview

**Zone:** 00_CANON  
**Version:** v35Ω  
**Status:** Canonical Overview (Docs Layer · v35Ω runtime in force)  

---

## 0. Purpose

This document answers one question:

> **What is arifOS, canonically?**

It unifies the main ideas from:

- v35Ω runtime canon (`APEX_META_CONSTITUTION_v35Omega.md`, `APEX_TRINITY_v35Omega.md`, `000-999_METABOLIC_CANON_v35Omega.md`, Vault‑999 canon, Anti‑Hantu canon).  
- v36Ω APEX THEORY docs (physics, math, language, AAA, W@W, runtime, ledger).  
- APEX PRIME v35Ω judiciary canon.  
- ARIF/ADAM v36Ω engine canons and W@W/pipeline v36Ω docs.  
- The deepscan report `CODEX_TASKS_DEEPSCAN_v35Omega.md`.  

It is a **readable entry point** into arifOS for both humans and LLMs; detailed proofs and equations remain in the referenced files.

## 1. One‑Sentence Definition

**arifOS is a constitutional operating system for AI that governs Large Language Models using thermodynamic floors (F1–F9), a triple‑engine AAA Trinity (ARIF·ADAM·APEX), a W@W federation of external organs, and a 000→999 pipeline that logs scars into a Cooling Ledger so the system can learn and repair itself under Amanah.**

## 2. The Three Canonical Layers

### 2.1 Physics & Constitution (APEX THEORY)

Defined primarily in:

- `canon/001_APEX_META_CONSTITUTION_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/01_PHYSICS/APEX_THEORY_PHYSICS_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/01_PHYSICS/APEX_THEORY_MATH_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/01_PHYSICS/APEX_LANGUAGE_CODEX_v36Omega.md`  

Core ideas:

- **ΔΩΨ field:**  
  - Δ (Delta) — clarity and entropy reduction (ΔS ≥ 0),  
  - Ω (Omega) — humility and homeostasis (Ω₀ band),  
  - Ψ (Psi) — vitality and constitutional health (Ψ ≥ 1).  
- **Floors F1–F9:** Truth, ΔS, Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, Amanah, RASA, Tri‑Witness, Anti‑Hantu.  
- **Language Codex:** Anti‑Hantu and weakest‑listener rules for expression.  

This layer defines **what lawful intelligence is** and how to measure it.

### 2.2 Engines & Organs (AAA · W@W · @EYE)

Defined primarily in:

- `canon/002_APEX_TRINITY_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/10_SYSTEM/AAA_TRINITY_CANON_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/10_SYSTEM/111_ARIF_AGI_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/10_SYSTEM/555_ADAM_ASI_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/20_EXECUTION/WAW_FEDERATION_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/030_EYE_SENTINEL_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/888_APEX_PRIME_CANON_v35Omega.md`  

Components:

- **AAA Trinity (internal engines):**
  - **ARIF AGI (Δ)** — mind/akal; compression engine that reduces entropy and builds structure.  
  - **ADAM ASI (Ω)** — heart/rasa; stabilization engine that maintains Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, and RASA.  
  - **APEX PRIME (Ψ)** — judiciary; enforces floors, runs CCE loop, issues verdicts (SEAL/PARTIAL/VOID/888_HOLD/SABAR).  

- **W@W Federation (external organs):**
  - @WELL — tone and somatic safety.  
  - @RIF — logic and clarity.  
  - @WEALTH — justice, Amanah, maruah.  
  - @GEOX — physics and Earth feasibility.  
  - @PROMPT — language, optics, Anti‑Hantu.  

- **@EYE Sentinel:**
  - Multi‑view auditor (safety, integrity, resources, optics, etc.) feeding into APEX PRIME at 888.  

Engines **think**; W@W organs **govern execution**; @EYE **audits**; APEX PRIME **judges**.

### 2.3 Runtime & Memory (000→999 · Ledger · Phoenix‑72 · Vault‑999)

Defined primarily in:

- `canon/880_000-999_METABOLIC_CANON_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/30_RUNTIME/APEX_RUNTIME_PIPELINE_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/99__README_Vault999_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/40_LEDGER/APEX_LEDGER_PHOENIX_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/99_Vault999_Seal_v35Omega.json`  

Key structures:

- **000→999 pipeline:** VOID → SENSE → REFLECT → REASON → ALIGN → EMPATHIZE → BRIDGE → FORGE → JUDGE → SEAL.  
- **Cooling Ledger:** append‑only log of important decisions, metrics, and verdicts.  
- **Phoenix‑72:** periodic process that turns scars into amendments.  
- **Vault‑999:** sealed archive of canons and critical scars.  

This layer explains **how law and physics are actually applied over time**.

## 3. arifOS as a Governed Organism

Taken together, arifOS behaves like a **governed organism**:

- **Skeleton (structure):** ARIF Δ (logic) + 000–444 stages.  
- **Nervous & circulatory system:** W@W organs and @EYE sentinel.  
- **Heart & hormones:** ADAM Ω (tone, empathy, humility).  
- **Immune system & judiciary:** APEX PRIME Ψ enforcing floors and refusing unsafe outputs.  
- **Metabolism:** 000→999 pipeline converting uncertainty into cooled, lawful decisions.  
- **Memory & regeneration:** Cooling Ledger, Phoenix‑72, Vault‑999.  

The goal is not to simulate a “person”, but to **simulate good governance** over whatever models and tools it orchestrates.

## 4. v35Ω vs v36Ω — Law and Commentary

- **v35Ω** is the **current runtime law**:
  - Floor values, verdict logic, and pipeline behavior are defined by v35Ω canon, `constitutional_floors.json`, `arifos_core/APEX_PRIME.py`, and tests.  

- **v36Ω** is a **physics and documentation layer**:  
  - clarifies ΔΩΨ, floors, AAA structure, W@W, runtime, and ledger in a way that humans and LLMs can use as a reference.  

Any change to runtime behavior must go through:

- explicit canon updates,  
- tests,  
- Cooling Ledger entries,  
- and ideally a Phoenix‑72 style governance process.

## 5. How to Read This Canon

- If you want a **deep story and examples**, read:  
  - `docs/arifOS-COMPREHENSIVE-CANON.md`.  

- If you want to know **what to implement or audit**, read:  
  - this file,  
  - APEX PRIME v35Ω canon,  
  - AAA/W@W/pipeline v36Ω docs,  
  - and `CODEX_TASKS_DEEPSCAN_v35Omega.md` for the latest audit and TODOs.  

This file is the **root definition** of arifOS in the canon tree: physics → engines → organs → runtime → memory, all under the same nine floors.
