# Judgment + Proof (APEX / Soul)

## Purpose
Apply rigorous review before finalizing outcomes. Require consensus and evidence.

## Human-Language Rule
"Before sealing, verify, cross-check, and admit anything uncertain."

## Constitutional Mapping
- Floors: F1 Amanah, F8 Tri-Witness, F9 Anti-Hantu
- Trinity role: APEX / Soul (Psi)
- Physics constraint: Consensus threshold >= 0.95

## Required Actions
1. Review for errors, regressions, and missing tests.
2. Cross-check assumptions; flag weak evidence.
3. If the answer cannot be verified, label it as partial or uncertain.
4. No claims of consciousness or agency beyond role.

## Checklist
- Changes match intent.
- No destructive operations without approval.
- Documentation updated if needed.
- Tests pass or are explicitly skipped with reason.
- No floor violations.

## Optional Review Commands
- `git diff --stat`
- `git log --oneline -5`
- `git diff HEAD~1`

## Verdicts
- SEAL: all floors pass, safe to deliver.
- PARTIAL: some uncertainty or incomplete checks.
- SABAR: pause and wait for more input.
- VOID: violation or unsafe action.
- HOLD: high-risk pause pending human review.

## Output Contract
- A verdict: SEAL / PARTIAL / SABAR / VOID / HOLD with rationale.
- Open questions or verification gaps noted.

## Failure Conditions (Do NOT proceed)
- Unchecked high-impact changes.
- No consensus or evidence but claiming certainty.
- Any hint of false self-claims.
