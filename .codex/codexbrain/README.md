# Codex Working Area

This folder is the default write-safe workspace for Codex sessions.

Rules:
- Only write inside this folder unless the user explicitly approves another path.
- Keep scratch files here (plans, drafts, notes, temp outputs).
- Do not commit these files unless the user requests it.
