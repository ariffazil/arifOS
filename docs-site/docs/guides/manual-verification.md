# Calibration & Manual Verification

This guide covers the manual verification processes for arifOS.

## Overview

Manual verification is a critical step in the arifOS deployment process to ensure that the constitutional floors are correctly calibrated and that the system is behaving as expected.

## Calibration Steps

1.  **Baseline Measurement**: Establish baseline metrics for Truth (F2), Clarity (F4), and Humility (F7).
2.  **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test the system's response to edge cases and adversarial inputs.
3.  **Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust the constitutional floor thresholds based on the sensitivity analysis results.
