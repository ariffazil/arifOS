# 444 ALIGN: Value Alignment

**Canon:** `000_THEORY/000_ARCHITECTURE.md §4`
**Engine:** APEX (Ψ Soul)

---

## Purpose

ALIGN is the **constitutional checkpoint** — verifying that proposed actions align with the 13 floors before empathy validation.

---

## When to Use

- Before implementing changes
- After reasoning and meta-cognition
- When validating architectural decisions
- Before high-stakes actions

---

## Steps

### 1. Constitution — Load Governance Context
```bash
# Reference agent governance
cat GEMINI.md  # or CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md
```

### 2. Floors — Check Hard Floors
- **F1** (Amanah) — Is action reversible or auditable?
- **F9** (Anti-Hantu) — No consciousness claims?

### 3. Values — Verify Alignment
- Does action serve the weakest stakeholder?
- Is "Ditempa Bukan Diberi" honored?
- Would 888 Judge approve?

---

## Constitutional Floors

**Primary:**
- **F1** (Amanah) — Reversibility/auditability
- **F3** (Tri-Witness) — Prepare consensus data

**Secondary:**
- **F9** (Anti-Hantu) — No role violations
- **F10** (Ontology) — Maintain boundaries

---

## Output

An **alignment verdict**:
- `PASS` — Proceed to 555 EMPATHY
- `WARN` — Document concern, proceed with caution
- `FAIL` — Return to 222 THINK for revision

---

## Next Stage

→ **555 EMPATHY** (Stakeholder impact validation)

---

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI**
