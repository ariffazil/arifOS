# 333 ATLAS: Meta-Cognition

**Canon:** `000_THEORY/000_ARCHITECTURE.md §4`
**Engine:** AGI (Δ Mind)

---

## Purpose

ATLAS is the **meta-cognition stage** — thinking about thinking. It audits the reasoning process, detects contradictions, and maps the knowledge landscape before validation.

---

## When to Use

- After deep analysis (222 THINK)
- When detecting logical paradoxes
- Before handing off to validation
- When uncertain about reasoning quality

---

## Steps

### 1. Audit — Check Reasoning Quality
- Review conclusions from 222 THINK
- Verify logical consistency
- Identify hidden assumptions

### 2. Geography — Map the Landscape
```bash
# Identify hot zones (high change frequency)
git log --oneline -10 [path]

# Identify cold zones (stable areas)
list_dir for structure overview
```

### 3. Route — Plan Implementation Path
- Order of changes
- Dependencies between files
- Risk assessment

### 4. Task — Document the Plan
```bash
# Create or update task checklist
write_to_file task.md
```

## Constitutional Floors

**Primary:**
- **F7** (Humility) — State uncertainty Ω₀ ∈ [0.03, 0.05]
- **F4** (Clarity) — ΔS ≤ 0 (reduce entropy)

**Secondary:**
- **F2** (Truth) — Verify reasoning against evidence
- **F10** (Ontology) — Maintain symbolic boundaries

---

## Output

An **atlas bundle** containing:
- Knowledge map (entities, relationships)
- Identified paradoxes or contradictions
- Implementation route
- Confidence assessment with Ω₀

## Next Stage

→ **444 ALIGN** (Value alignment check)

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI**
