# 666 BRIDGE: The Gatekeeper

**Canon:** `000_THEORY/000_ARCHITECTURE.md §4`
**Engine:** ASI (Ω Heart)

---

## Purpose

BRIDGE is the **neuro-symbolic gateway** — translating abstract reasoning into concrete executable steps. It's the final ASI checkpoint before action.

---

## When to Use

- After empathy validation passes
- When converting design to implementation
- Before actual code execution
- As final safety gate

---

## Steps

### 1. Review — Check Previous Stages
- 444 ALIGN — Constitutional alignment?
- 555 EMPATHY — Stakeholder protection?
- All verdicts should be PASS

### 2. Gate — Decision Point
| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PASS | Proceed to synthesis |
| WARN | Add safeguards, proceed cautiously |
| FAIL | Return to earlier stage |

### 3. Translate — Abstract → Concrete
- Convert reasoning to specific file changes
- Map intent to tool calls
- Define verification criteria

### 4. Authority — Verify Permissions
- F11 (Command Auth) — Is this authorized?
- F1 (Amanah) — Can this be undone?

---

## Constitutional Floors

**Primary:**
- **F1** (Amanah) — Reversibility confirmed
- **F11** (Command Auth) — Authority verified
- **F12** (Injection Defense) — Safe from manipulation

**Secondary:**
- **F5** (Peace²) — Non-destructive
- **F6** (Empathy) — Stakeholders protected

---

## Output

An **execution plan** containing:
- Concrete steps (tool calls, file edits)
- Verification criteria
- Rollback procedure if needed
- Authority confirmation

---

## Next Stage

→ **777 EUREKA** (Execute and synthesize learnings)

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI**
