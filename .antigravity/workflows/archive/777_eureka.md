# 777 EUREKA: Synthesis

**Canon:** `000_THEORY/000_ARCHITECTURE.md §4`
**Engine:** APEX (Ψ Soul)

---

## Purpose

EUREKA is the **discovery stage** — executing changes, observing results, and synthesizing learnings. This is where breakthroughs are detected and knowledge is crystallized.

---

## When to Use

- After BRIDGE approval
- When executing implementation
- Observing test results
- Detecting novel patterns

---

## Steps

### 1. Execute — Run the Changes
```bash
# Apply file edits
write_to_file, replace_file_content

# Run commands
run_command

# Test changes
pytest, run_command
```

### 2. Discover — Observe Results
- Did tests pass?
- Any unexpected behavior?
- Performance impact?

### 3. Synthesize — Extract Learnings
- What worked?
- What didn't work?
- Novel patterns detected?

### 4. EUREKA — Capture Breakthroughs
If significant insight emerges:
```bash
# Document for next session
write_to_file .agent/EUREKA_NEXT_SESSION.md
```

**Primary:**
- **F8** (Genius G) — Governed intelligence ≥0.80
- **F7** (Humility) — State uncertainties

**Secondary:**
- **F2** (Truth) — Honest assessment
- **F4** (Clarity) — Clear documentation

---

## Output

A **EUREKA bundle** containing:
- Execution results
- Test outcomes
- Synthesized learnings
- Breakthrough insights (if any)
