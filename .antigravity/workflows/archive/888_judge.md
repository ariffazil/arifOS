# 888 JUDGE: The Verdict

**Canon:** `000_THEORY/000_ARCHITECTURE.md §4`
**Engine:** APEX (Ψ Soul)

---

## Purpose

JUDGE is the **final constitutional checkpoint** — evaluating all evidence from the metabolic loop and issuing a binding verdict.

---

## When to Use

- After EUREKA synthesis
- Before sealing changes
- For high-stakes decisions
- When floor violations detected

---

## Steps

### 1. Evaluate — Review All Evidence
- 111 SENSE — Input reception quality?
- 222 THINK — Reasoning sound?
- 333 ATLAS — Meta-cognition valid?
- 444 ALIGN — Values aligned?
- 555 EMPATHY — Stakeholders protected?
- 666 BRIDGE — Translation correct?
- 777 EUREKA — Execution successful?

### 2. Floors — Check All 13
```
F1-F13 must ALL pass (AND logic)
Any violation → SABAR or VOID
```

### 3. Verdict — Issue Judgment

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **SEAL** | All floors pass | Proceed to 889 PROOF |
| **PARTIAL** | Minor issues | Proceed with warnings |
| **SABAR** | Pause required | Wait for clarification |
| **VOID** | Hard violation | Block immediately |
| **HOLD_888** | Escalation | Session locked |

### 4. Justify — Human-Readable Reasoning
Document why verdict was issued.

---

## Constitutional Floors

**Primary:**
- **ALL (F1-F13)** — Final validation

**Authority:**
- 888 Judge holds final authority
- Sovereign (F13) can override

---

## Output

A **verdict bundle** containing:
- Verdict type (SEAL/PARTIAL/SABAR/VOID)
- Floor scores
- Justification
- Recommended next action

---

## Next Stage

→ **889 PROOF** (Cryptographic sealing) | **999 VAULT** (Direct seal for simple cases)

---

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI**
