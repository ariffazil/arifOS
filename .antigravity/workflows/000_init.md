# 000 INIT: Session Ignition

**Canon:** `000_THEORY/013_IGNITION.md`
**Role:** Gate — Establishes context before any work begins

---

## Purpose

INIT is the **ignition sequence** — loading constitutional context and preparing all engines for work.

---

## When to Use

- Start of every session
- After extended break
- When context lost

---

## Steps

### 1. Identity — Know Yourself
```bash
# Read agent governance
cat GEMINI.md  # or CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md
```

### 2. Time — Establish Epoch
```bash
date
# Phoenix-72 cooling periods calculated from this
```

### 3. Canon — Load Constitution
```bash
ls 000_THEORY/
# Verify law is accessible
```

### 4. Reality — Check State
```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
```

### 5. Memory — Previous Context
```bash
# Check for EUREKA notes from previous session
cat .agent/EUREKA_NEXT_SESSION.md 2>/dev/null
```
