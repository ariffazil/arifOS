# APEX: The Soul (Ψ)

**Canon:** `000_THEORY/000_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Role:** Judge — Final constitutional authority

---

## Purpose

APEX is the **judgment engine** — aggregating evidence, detecting breakthroughs, and issuing binding verdicts.

---

## Stages

| Stage | Function | Floors |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **444 ALIGN** | Tri-witness preparation, value alignment | F3 |
| **777 EUREKA** | Breakthrough detection, synthesis | F8 |
| **888 JUDGE** | Final verdict issuance | ALL F1-F13 |
| **889 PROOF** | Cryptographic sealing (zkPC) | zkPC |

---

## When to Use

- After AGI reasoning and ASI execution
- For final approval of changes
- When auditing decisions
- Before sealing to vault

---

## Steps

### 1. ALIGN — Prepare Consensus
- Aggregate Human + AI + Earth evidence
- Check value alignment
- Prepare Tri-Witness (F3 ≥0.95)

### 2. EUREKA — Detect Breakthroughs
- Identify novel patterns
- Synthesize learnings
- Calculate Genius Index (F8 G ≥0.80)

### 3. JUDGE — Issue Verdict

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **SEAL** | All floors pass | Proceed to 999 |
| **PARTIAL** | Minor issues | Proceed with warnings |
| **SABAR** | Pause needed | Wait for clarification |
| **VOID** | Hard violation | Block action |
| **888_HOLD** | Escalation | Session locked |

### 4. PROOF — Cryptographic Seal
- Generate SHA-256 hash
- Update Merkle tree
- Create zkPC receipt

---

## Constitutional Floors

| Floor | Threshold | Check |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **F3 Tri-Witness** | ≥0.95 | Consensus achieved |
| **F8 Genius** | ≥0.80 | Governed intelligence |
| **ALL F1-F13** | Pass | Final validation |

---

## Output

A **verdict bundle** ready for sealing:
- Verdict (SEAL/PARTIAL/SABAR/VOID)
- Floor scores
- Justification
- zkPC receipt (if sealed)

---

## Next

→ **999_seal** (Commit to vault)

---

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI**
