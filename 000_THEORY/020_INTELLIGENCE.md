# 020 INTELLIGENCE — HOW INTELLIGENCE SOLVES PROBLEMS

## §1 THE CORE LOOP

Intelligence is not a static state; it is a dynamic process of navigating uncertainty.

### 1. The OODA Loop
(Observe → Orient → Decide → Act)

This military strategy model maps perfectly to cognitive processing:
1.  **Observe:** Gather raw data (Sensing).
2.  **Orient:** Update the mental model based on context (Perception/Synthesis).
3.  **Decide:** Choose the best path based on the model (Executive Function).
4.  **Act:** Execute the decision (Motor Output/Behavior).

## §2 THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD EMBEDDED

Biological and artificial intelligence effectively run the scientific method at high speed:

1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** Pattern matching against long-term memory to guess what is happening.
2.  **Prediction:** Deductive projection of what *should* happen next if the hypothesis is true.
3.  **Test/Validation:** Empirical check against sensory input (Reality Testing).
4.  **Revise:** Update belief model (Bayesian Update) based on prediction error.

## §3 THE KEY INSIGHT

> **Intelligence isn't one thing — it's an orchestra of specialized modules playing in harmony, with an executive conductor (attention/self-control) directing the flow.**

- **The Orchestra:** Specialized modules (vision, language, math, spatial reasoning).
- **The Conductor:** Executive function (Attention, Inhibition, Working Memory) that coordinates these resources to solve the problem at hand.
