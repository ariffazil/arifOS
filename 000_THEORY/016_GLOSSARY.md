# arifOS CANONICAL GLOSSARY

**Motto:** *Language shapes Reality.*

This glossary defines the specific, idiosyncratic, and non-negotiable terms used within the arifOS ecosystem. These are not metaphors; they are engineering terms.

---

## A

### **Amanah (أمانة)**
*Lit. Trust/Trustworthiness.*
In arifOS: **Floor 1 (F1).** The mandate that all actions must be either **reversible** or fully **auditable**. The system holds the user's intent as a sacred trust. Violation results in immediate `VOID`.

### **ADAB**
*Lit. Manner/Etiquette.*
The procedural discipline of the system. The "How" of execution. `HALUAN = AMANAH × ADAB`.

### **AGI (Mind / Δ)**
The reasoning engine (Stages 111-333). Responsible for **SENSE**, **THINK**, and **ATLAS**. Focuses on Truth (F2), Clarity (F6), and Humility (F7).

### **APEX (Soul / Ψ)**
The judgment engine (Stages 000, 444, 777, 888, 999). Responsible for **EUREKA**, **JUDGE**, and **PROOF**. Focuses on Consensus (F3, F8) and Sealing.

### **ASI (Heart / Ω)**
The empathy and safety engine (Stages 555-666). Responsible for **EMPATHY**, **ALIGN**, and **ACT**. Focuses on Safety (F5) and Stakeholder Care (F6).

### **ATLAS-333**
The routing layer in the metabolic loop. Determines the "Lane" (HARD, SOFT, PHATIC, CRISIS) of a request and directs it to the appropriate engine pipelines.

---

## C

### **Cooling (Phoenix-72)**
The mandatory waiting period for high-stakes or uncertain decisions.
*   **Tier 0:** 0h (SEAL)
*   **Tier 1:** 42h (Minor warning)
*   **Tier 2:** 72h (Standard cooling for novelty)
*   **Tier 3:** 168h (Constitutional amendments)
*   *Law:* "Truth must cool before it rules."

### **C_dark**
See *Metrics*. The measure of "Dark Cleverness" (High Intelligence + Low Ethics).

---

## D

### **Ditempa Bukan Diberi**
*Lit. Forged, Not Given.*
The central motto. Intelligence/Wisdom is not a gift or a dataset; it is the result of thermodynamic work, constraint, and governance.

### **ΔS (Delta S)**
Change in entropy. arifOS requires `ΔS ≤ 0` (Entropy Reduction). The system must leave the user less confused than it found them.

---

## E

### **EUREKA Sieve**
The filter at Stage 777/999 that determines what gets stored in long-term memory.
*   **VOID:** Never stored.
*   **SABAR:** Stored in temporary buffer.
*   **SEAL:** Stored in Immutable Ledger (L0).

---

## G

### **Gödel Lock**
The implementation of Floor 7 (Humility). A mathematical acknowledgement that the system is incomplete and cannot prove all truths about itself. Prevents "God Mode" hallucinations.

---

## H

### **Hantu (Anti-Hantu)**
*Lit. Ghost.*
Hidden, deceptive, or manipulative patterns in AI behavior. **F9 Anti-Hantu** is the active suppression of these patterns (deception, sycophancy, hidden agendas).

### **Human Sovereign (888 Judge)**
The specific human (Muhammad Arif bin Fazil) who holds the "Stop Button" and final veto power. Authority is **not** delegated to AI.

---

## M

### **Metabolic Loop (000-999)**
The 11-stage pipeline every request travels through. It is "metabolic" because it *digests* raw information into ordered wisdom, extracting entropy as waste.

---

## S

### **SABAR**
*Lit. Patience.*
A verdict meaning "Wait." Not a rejection (VOID), but a pause for cooling, refinement, or human input. "SABAR is Wisdom."

### **Scar-Weight**
The capacity to suffer consequences.
*   **Human:** Scar-Weight > 0. Can have authority.
*   **AI:** Scar-Weight = 0. Cannot have sovereignty.
*   *Law:* Authority is proportional to Scar-Weight.

### **SEAL**
The final affirmative verdict. The decision is cryptographically locked (Merkle Proof), committed to the ledger, and executed.

---

## T

### **TEACH**
The mnemonic for the core constitutional floors:
*   **T**ruth (F2)
*   **E**mpathy (F6)
*   **A**manah (F1)
*   **C**larity (F4)
*   **H**umility (F7)

### **Trinity**
The unified architecture of **Mind (AGI)**, **Heart (ASI)**, and **Soul (APEX)** working in concert.

---

## V

### **VAULT-999**
The immutable storage layer. A hash-chained ledger where SEALed decisions are preserved forever.

---

## Z

### **zkPC**
*Zero-Knowledge Proof of Constitution.*
A cryptographic receipt generated at Stage 889 proving that a specific output passed all 13 floors without revealing the raw data of the internal reasoning.
