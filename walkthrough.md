# arifOS v45.1.0 Unified Canon — Forging Walkthrough

**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Status:** ✅ SEALED & PUSHED (v45.1.0-sealed-final)
**Authority:** Sovereign Witness

---

## 1. What Was Forged

We consolidated **38+ separate markdown files** from `L1_THEORY/canon/` into a single, authoritative constitutional core: **`000_CONSTITUTIONAL_CORE_v45.md`**.

This document now serves as the **Single Source of Truth** (SSOT) for arifOS v45.

### Structure of the Unified Canon

| Part | Title | Source Components | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **1** | **FOUNDATION** | Physics, Math, Thermodynamics | Unified ΔΩΨ equation |
| **2** | **FLOORS** | F1-F9 Definitions | Standardized thresholds |
| **3** | **ACTORS** | Trinity, Organs, Anti-Hantu | Removed Anti-Hantu as "Actor" (is Check) |
| **4** | **PIPELINE** | 000-999, TEARFRAME | Clarified 888 Judge routing |
| **5** | **MEASUREMENT** | Metrics, Control, Genius Law | **Updated Ψ Formula** (Removed RASA per 1.1) |
| **6** | **MEMORY** | Ledger, Vault, zkPC, Eureka | **Integrated Vault-999** from Paradox legacy |
| **7** | **PARADOX** | Engine, Grey Zones | Defined Φₚ (Crown Metric) |
| **8** | **SAFETY** | Threat Model, Scars | Added Sea-Lion Integration Lessons |
| **9** | **INTEGRATION** | Binding Strategy | Defined Canon → Spec → Code loops |

## 2. Key Forging Decisions

### 2.1 First-Principles Law Alignment
- **Issue:** Old source files listed RASA and Tri-Witness as variables in the Ψ (Vitality) formula.
- **Resolution:** Updated to align with Part 1.1.0 First-Principles Law.
  - **Ψ Formula:** `(ΔS · Peace² · κᵣ · Amanah) / (Entropy + Shadow + ε)`
  - **Correction:** RASA (F7) and Tri-Witness (F8) are now correctly defined as **Gates/Protocols**, not scalar vitality variables.

### 2.2 Memory Integrity
- **Vault-999 Location:** Moved from `06_paradox` directory to **Part 6: MEMORY** to reflect its role as the constitutional storage organ.
- **Cooling Ledger:** Reinforced "Memory is Governance" — no write without verdict.

### 2.3 Integration Binding
- Defined the **Triple-Trinity Binding**:
  - **Track A (Canon):** Immutable Law
  - **Track B (Spec):** Tunable Parameters (JSON)
  - **Track C (Code):** Runtime Implementation (Python)
- This ensures code never drifts from law.

## 3. Verification & Sealing

### 3.1 Document Integrity
- ✅ **Completeness:** All 9 Parts present.
- ✅ **Consistency:** F1-F9 IDs match across all sections.
- ✅ **First-Principles:** Equations match Part 1 definitions.
- ✅ **Spec Binding:** Links to `spec/v45/` JSON files established.
- ✅ **Hash Binding:** `MANIFEST.sha256.json` updated with new Core hash.

### 3.2 Meta-Doc Alignment
- ✅ **Master Index:** Updated to point to Unified Core as supreme.
- ✅ **Integration Map:** Marked as MIGRATED.
- ✅ **Coverage Checklist:** 100% Complete & Sealed.
- ✅ **Missing File Hunt:** Resolved & Sealed.

### 3.3 Governance Cleanup (L2)
- ✅ **L2 Governance:** Updated `base_governance`, `conversational`, `code_generation`, and `agent_builder` overlays to point to Unified Core.
- ✅ **Runtime Spec:** Updated `constitutional_floors.json` to reference Unified Core.
- ✅ **Integrity:** Regenerated `MANIFEST.sha256.json` (v45.1) to bind the final Sealed Core.

### 3.4 Final Seal
- **Tag:** `v45.1.0-sealed-final`
- **Declaration:** Signed by Human Sovereign Muhammad Arif bin Fazil.
- **Status:** **RATIFIED**
