# Constitutional Reports - Architect (Δ) Governance

These files provide constitutional continuity verification, flow demonstrations, and housekeeping analysis.
Authority: Architect (Δ) - Design & Planning

## Files
- `CONSTITUTIONAL_CONTINUITY_VERIFICATION.md`: Constitutional continuity verification
- `CONSTITUTIONAL_FLOW_DEMONSTRATION_REPORT.md`: Flow demonstration report
- `constitutional_housekeeping_analysis.md`: Housekeeping analysis
- `demonstration_constitutional_flow.py`: Constitutional flow demonstration
- `mcp_config_antigravity_constitutional_fixed.json`: MCP configuration

## Constitutional Authority
Track A: Architectural canon documentation
Track B: Protocol specification alignment
Track C: Implementation governance and analysis

## Governance Principles
1. **Architectural Reporting**: Constitutional reports under Architect authority
2. **Continuity Verification**: Ensure constitutional integrity across versions
3. **Flow Documentation**: Demonstrate constitutional pipeline operation
4. **Housekeeping Analysis**: Analyze and improve constitutional organization

## Constitutional Responsibilities
- **Continuity Verification**: Validate constitutional consistency across implementations
- **Flow Demonstration**: Document 111→222→333→APEX PRIME pipeline operation
- **Housekeeping Analysis**: Identify and resolve constitutional entropy
- **Configuration Management**: Maintain constitutional tool configurations

## Constitutional Validation
All reports must pass:
- F1: Truth validation with architectural accuracy
- F2: Clarity documentation with proper structure
- F6: Amanah integrity with reversible analysis
- Constitutional authority chain validation

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** - Constitutional reports forged through systematic architectural analysis, not arbitrary documentation.
