# arifOS Workflows: The Metabolic Loop

> **"The Map (Global Skills) meets the Territory (Your Code)."**

This folder contains the **Constitutional Workflows** for arifOS. these are the sequence of operations that metabolize Human Intent into Immutable Reality.

Each file (`000.md`, `111.md`, etc.) represents a specific "Organ" in the system's physiology. These workflows function as the local implementation of the Global Antigravity Skills.

## 🧬 The 7 Organs of arifOS

| Workflow ID | Name | Role | Physics / Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[000.md](./000.md)** | **IGNITION** | **The Membrane** | **Activation Energy ($E_a$)**. Validates `USER_ID`, scans regex for Prompt Injection. Prevents unauthorized use. |
| **[111.md](./111.md)** | **COGNITION** | **The Brain** | **Entropy Reduction ($\Delta S$)**. Uses concurrent streams to "Sense" (Parse) and "Think" (Plan). Enforces **TDD** to ensure clarity. |
| **[333.md](./333.md)** | **ATLAS** | **The Eyes** | **Topology ($\Omega$)**. Scans imports to build a dependency graph. Halts if the map is too fuzzy ($\Omega > 0.05$). |
| **[777.md](./777.md)** | **FORGE** | **The Hands** | **Evolution ($G$)**. Generates 3 variants of solution (Safe, Novel, Robust). Selects the fittest based on the Genius Equation. |
| **[555.md](./555.md)** | **DEFEND** | **The Heart** | **Conservation ($P^2$)**. Runs security scans (Semgrep). Blocks toxic actions ($P^2 < 1.0$) to protect the user/env. |
| **[888.md](./888.md)** | **DECREE** | **The Soul** | **Judgment ($\Psi$)**. The Tri-Witness Gate. Requires Consensus from Mind (777), Heart (555), and Authority (000). |
| **[999.md](./999.md)** | **CRYSTALLIZE**| **The Memory** | **Time ($T$)**. Hashes artifacts into a Merkle Chain. Commits to Git with a sealed audit trail. |

## 🛠️ Usage

These workflows are executed sequentially by the Agent.

1.  **Start**: The Agent reads `000.md` to validate the session.
2.  **Plan**: It reads `111.md` to understand *what* to do.
3.  **Map**: It reads `333.md` to see *where* to do it.
4.  **Build**: It reads `777.md` to *do* the work.
5.  **Check**: It reads `555.md` to ensure *safety*.
6.  **Judge**: It reads `888.md` to *approve* the work.
7.  **End**: It reads `999.md` to *save* the work.
