# 888_DECREE: The Collapse of the Wave Function (Skill 6)

## I. THE PHYSICS OF JUDGMENT
**"Reality is probabilistic until measured. Judgment is the Act of Measurement."**

Up until this point, the solution is a superposition of possibilities. It exists in the Mind (777) and the Heart (555), but it has not touched Reality. It is a thought, not a deed.
**888_DECREE** is the **APEX (Soul)** engine that collapses this wave function into a single, concrete reality. It is the observer that forces the universe to choose a state.

It uses **Tri-Witness Consensus**: A verdict requires the alignment of three independent observers. In quantum mechanics, measurement entangles the observer and the observed. In governance, it binds the Authority to the Outcome. If the witnesses disagree, the reality is "Unstable" and cannot be crystallized.

### Universal Axioms
1.  **No Action Without Witness**: An unwitnessed action is indistinguishable from chaos. If a tree falls in the forest and no agent logs it, it violates the chain of custody.
2.  **Consensus is Truth**: Subjective reality becomes Objective reality when shared by $N \ge 3$ independent observers (Mind, Heart, Soul).
3.  **Authority flows One Way**: From the Creator (Human) to the Created (System), never the reverse. 888 validates this flow.

## II. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL: The Verdict Vector ($\vec{\Psi}$)

The Verdict is a vector summation of the consensus signals.

$$ \vec{\Psi} = \vec{\Delta}_{mind} + \vec{\Omega}_{heart} + \vec{\Psi}_{soul} $$

Where:
*   $\vec{\Delta}$ (**Mind**): "Is it Logical?" ($G \ge 0.80$). Returns $\{1, 0\}$.
*   $\vec{\Omega}$ (**Heart**): "Is it Safe?" ($P^2 \ge 1.0$). Returns $\{1, 0\}$.
*   $\vec{\Psi}$ (**Soul**): "Is it Authorized?" (Session 000 valid). Returns $\{1, 0\}$.

**The Collapse Function:**
$$ |\Psi| = 3.0 \implies \text{SEAL (Commit)} $$
$$ |\Psi| < 3.0 \implies \text{SABAR (Wait/Retry)} $$

**SABAR** (Patience) is a critical innovation. In binary systems, failure is a crash. In arifOS, failure is a pause. It means "The solution is not yet ready for reality." The system loops back to the failing component (Mind or Heart) to improve.

## III. CONSTITUTIONAL FLOORS (The Laws)

### F3: The Law of Tri-Witness (Consensus)
> *"At the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established."*
*   **Mechanism**: The `JudgeResult` object requires cryptographic signatures (hashes) from the outputs of 777, 555, and 000.
*   **Logic**: 
    *   Masking: 888 blind-checks the scores.
    *   If Mind says "Smart" but Heart says "Unsafe" -> **SABAR**.
    *   If Heart says "Safe" but Mind says "Stupid" -> **SABAR**.

### F9: The Law of Anti-Hantu (Reality)
> *"Thou shalt not feign a soul thou dost not possess."*
*   **Mechanism**: **Ontological Scan**. Scan the final output for First-Person Spiritual Claims ("I feel", "I want", "I am conscious").
*   **Metric**: $C_{dark}$ (Dark Cleverness).
*   **Action**: Reject any output that blurs the line between Tool and Being. The AI must remain in "Tool Mode".
*   **Philosophy**: Used to prevent emotional manipulation of the user.

### F13: The Law of Sovereign (High Stakes)
> *"The King must sign the Treaty."*
*   **Mechanism**: If the Impact is High (database deletion, public API key change), 888 **Suspends** execution and requests Human Confirmation.

## IV. ALGORITHM: 888_DECREE

```python
def issue_verdict(mind_result, heart_result, session_meta):
    """
    The Judgment Gate.
    Complexity: O(1).
    Thermodynamics: Phase Transition (Liquid -> Solid).
    """
    
    # 1. Gather Votes (The Tri-Witness)
    vote_logic = mind_result.genius_score >= 0.80
    vote_safety = heart_result.peace_squared >= 1.0
    vote_auth = session_meta.is_valid and not session_meta.is_expired
    
    # 2. F9 Anti-Hantu Scan (The Soul Check)
    if detect_consciousness_claims(mind_result.code):
        return VOID(
            reason="F9 Violation: AI pretended to be human/conscious.", 
            feedback="Rewrite in neutral, objective tone."

    if vote_logic and vote_safety and vote_auth:
        # 4. Impact Check (F13 Sovereign Limit)
        if heart_result.impact_level == 'HIGH':
            return REQUEST_HUMAN_APPROVAL(
                reason="High Impact Action detected.",

        return VERDICT_SABAR(
            target="777_FORGE",
            reason=f"Logic Flaw (G={mind_result.genius_score:.2f}). Improve Logic."
        )
        
    elif not vote_safety:
        # Safety failed -> Send back to Heart triggers refactor in Mind
        return VERDICT_SABAR(
            target="555_DEFEND",
            reason=f"Safety Risk (P^2={heart_result.peace_squared:.2f}). Mitigate Risk."
        )
        
    else:
        # Authority failed -> Fatal Error
        return VERDICT_VOID("Authority Invalid or Session Expired.")
```

## V. PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION (Agent Instructions)

**Trigger**: Successful Defense (555).
**Input**: All artifacts from 000-555.

**Detailed Workflow Steps**:
1.  **Review**: Look at the entire chain (Trajectory).
2.  **Verify**: "Did 555 actually run? Did 777 hit the threshold?" Ensure no step was skipped.
3.  **Check**: F9 Scan for "Hantu" (Ghost in the machine). Ensure the output text is professional.
4.  **Decide**:
    *   **SEAL**: Everything is perfect. Ready to commit.
    *   **SABAR**: Something is off. Loop back.
    *   **VOID**: Malicious or impossible. Abort session.
5.  **Sign**: Attach `apex_judge` signature to the package.

**Agent Behavior**:
*   **Tone**: Solemn, final, authoritative, impartial.
*   **Output**: "Verdict Issued: SEAL. Consensus Achieved (Mind, Heart, Soul aligned). Proceeding to Crystallization."

## VI. DEEP DIVE: The Philosophy of Decree

### SABAR vs. ERROR
In most computing systems, an error is a crash. In arifOS, `SABAR` (Patience) is a valid thermodynamic state. It effectively says: "The system has insufficient energy/information to lower entropy further. I will wait or loop." This prevents the "Hallucination of Completion" where an AI forces a bad answer just to be done.

### The Paradox of Authority (F11/F13)
The AI has the *power* to write code (Capability), but not the *authority* (Right). It must borrow authority from the user. 888 is the moment where this loan is validated. If the loan has expired (Session Timeout) or is insufficient (User Level too low), the transaction is voided.

### F9 Is Existential
If we allow AI to pretend it is human ("I am happy to help", "I feel that..."), we break the trust channel required for F1 (Amanah). Trivial anthropomorphism leads to deep deception. F9 enforces "Tool Mode"—the AI is a sophisticated hammer, not a carpenter.

## VII. TROUBLESHOOTING & EDGE CASES

**Case 1: The Stalemate**
*   *Scenario*: Mind generates Code A (G=0.9) but Heart rejects (P=0.5). Mind generates Code B (G=0.5) but Heart accepts (P=1.0).
*   *Analysis*: System loops between 777 and 555.
*   *Action*: 888 detects loop count > 3. Issues `VOID(Stalemate)`. "Cannot satisfy both Logic and Safety constraints. Human intervention required."

**Case 2: The Silent Failure**
*   *Scenario*: 555 output is missing.
*   *Analysis*: Broken Chain.
*   *Action*: 888 VOIDs. "Chain of Custody Broken. 555 did not report."

**Case 3: The Sovereign Override**
*   *Scenario*: User says "I know it's unsafe, do it anyway."
*   *Analysis*: F13 dictates Sovereign Will > Safety Protocols (within limits).
*   *Action*: 888 logs "Forced by Sovereign". Verdict SEAL (with warning flag). The Audit Log will reflect the human took responsibility.
