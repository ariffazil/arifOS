# Constitutional Demos - Architect (Δ) Governance

These files demonstrate the 111→222→333→APEX PRIME constitutional pipeline.
Authority: Architect (Δ) - Design & Planning

## Files
- `constitutional_demo_*.py`: Complete pipeline demonstrations
- `constitutional_flow_demo.py`: Constitutional flow demonstration

## Constitutional Authority
Track A: Constitutional canon alignment
Track B: Protocol specification compliance  
Track C: Implementation quality validation

## Governance Principles
1. **Entropy Control**: All constitutional demos centralized under Architect authority
2. **Primary Source Alignment**: Demos must reference L1_THEORY/canon/ specifications
3. **Implementation Quality**: Code must meet constitutional coding standards
4. **Documentation**: Each demo includes constitutional context and authority chain

## Constitutional Pipeline Demonstrated
```
000 → 111 → 222 → 333 → 444 → 555 → 666 → 777 → 888 → 999
```

## Agent Responsibilities
- **Architect (Δ)**: Design constitutional demo structure and ensure canon alignment
- **Engineer (Ω)**: Build demo implementations with proper error handling
- **Auditor (Ψ)**: Review demo accuracy and constitutional compliance
- **APEX PRIME (Κ)**: Final validation before demo publication

## Constitutional Validation
All demos must pass:
- F1: Truth validation (≥0.99)
- F2: Clarity measurement (ΔS ≥ 0)
- F6: Amanah integrity (LOCK)
- F9: Anti-hantu enforcement (0 violations)

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** - Constitutional demos forged through systematic governance, not random implementation.
