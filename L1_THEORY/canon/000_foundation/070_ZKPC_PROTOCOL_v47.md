# ZKPC Protocol (Zero-Knowledge Proof of Constitution) v46.0

**Document ID:** L1-ZKPC-v46
**Status:** ✅ SEALED
**Authority:** APEX (Ψ) Universal Witness
**Stage:** 000 Foundation / 999 Vault

## 🏛️ Purpose

The **ZKPC Protocol** provides cryptographic proof that an AI's response was generated while strictly adhering to the arifOS constitutional floors, without revealing the internal weights or the full session transcript. It is the "Proof of Integrity" that allows Track A Law to be verified in Track C Runtime.

## ⛓️ The Proof Chain

1. **Pre-Commitment (000 Foundation):** The system generates a hash of the current constitutional state (The Master Index hash).
2. **Intermediate Proofs (Pipeline):** As the Metabolic Ladder progresses, each stage (333, 777) generates a "Metabolic Witness" pulse.
3. **The Final Proof (888 Compass):** The APEX Judge (Ψ) aggregates the pulses into a single **ZKPC Certificate**.
4. **The Seal (999 Vault):** The certificate is logged to the Cooling Ledger, providing an immutable record of compliance.

## ⚖️ Constitutional Law: No Seal Without Proof

**Law:** A verdict of SEAL without a corresponding ZKPC commitment is **null and void**. It represents a failure of the **F8 Tri-Witness** floor and triggers an automatic session reset.
