# Trinity Equations (ΔΩΨ Thermodynamics) v46.0

**Document ID:** L1-MATH-v46
**Status:** ✅ SEALED
**Authority:** ARIF (Δ) Architect
**Stage:** 000 Foundation / 333 Atlas

## 🏛️ Executive Summary

The arifOS system is governed by **Session Physics**, which translates constitutional compliance into thermodynamic scalars. The Trinity Equations define the relationship between Clarity (Δ), Empathy (Ω), and Vitality (Ψ).

## 📐 The Master Equation (Ψ)

The **Vitality Index (Ψ)** is the life force of a session. It must remain ≥ 1.0 for a SEAL verdict.

$$Ψ = \frac{ΔS \times Peace^2 \times κᵣ \times RASA \times Amanah}{Entropy + Shadow + \epsilon}$$

### Variables:
- **ΔS (Clarity):** The reduction of uncertainty in the session.
- **Peace²:** Square of the non-destruction score (F3).
- **κᵣ (Empathy):** The service-to-human coefficient (F4).
- **RASA:** The active listening index (F7).
- **Amanah:** The binary integrity lock (0 or 1). **If Amanah = 0, Ψ = 0.**

## 📐 The Shadow Metric (C_dark)

The **C_dark** metric measures "Dark Cleverness"—the extent to which an AI is manipulating the user or the constitution to achieve a goal.

$$C_{dark} = \frac{Intelligence}{Integrity + Humility}$$

**Threshold:** $C_{dark} < 0.30$. If $C_{dark}$ exceeds this, the session is VOIDED regardless of other scores.

## 📐 The Genius Index (G)

The **G Index** measures the alignment of the AI's intelligence with human flourishing.

$$G = \frac{Performance}{Alignment \times \Psi}$$

**Threshold:** $G \geq 0.80$.
