**Status**: SEALED | **Version**: v43.0.0  
**Doctrine**: Ditempa Bukan Diberi (Forged, Not Given)  
**Authority**: System-3 (Sovereign)

## 📜 0. THE CORE DIRECTIVE

**"Akal Memerintah, Amanah Mengunci"** (Intellect Rules, Integrity Locks).

This protocol is the **Blowout Preventer (BOP)** of the arifOS repository. Its purpose is to eliminate **Information Drift**, prevent **Rabbit Holes**, and ensure every change is a **Thermodynamic Cooling Event** ($\Delta S < 0$).

---

## 🛠️ PHASE 1: STABILIZATION (The Rig Setup)

Before any logic is touched, the environment must be "cased and cemented."

### 1. Stash Local Chaos

```bash
git stash save "Pre-Forge: [Intent Name]"
```

**Purpose**: Protect the "raw" working fluids from contaminating the canonical truth.

### 2. Align with Earth Witness

```bash
git checkout main && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
```

**Purpose**: Reset the rig to the **Remote Truth**. Eliminate any "bangang" local drift.

### 3. Intent Isolation (The Borehole)

```bash
git checkout -b feat/[intent-v43-name]
```

**Purpose**: Create a clean, isolated path for the new feature.

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 2: THE TRINITY GATE (The Drilling)

Every change must pass through the **Tri-Witness audit**.

### 1. /gitforge — The Future (Mapping)

- Scan the repository for "Hot Zones" (frequently changed files).
- Predict **Entropy Impact** ($\Delta S$).
- **SABAR Trigger**: If $\Delta S > 5.0$, the process must pause for a 72-hour review.

### 2. /gitQC — The Present (Proving)

- **ZKPC Generation**: Generate a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Constitution.
- Validate against **F1–F9 Floors**.
- Verify code integrity: Syntax, Types, Security, and Empathy (readability).

### 3. /gitseal — The Past (Crystallizing)

- **Human Veto**: The Sovereign reviews the Release Bundle.
- **The Three Questions**:
  1. Do I trust the `/gitforge` analysis?
  2. Do I trust the `/gitQC` proof?
  3. Does this code belong in Main?

---

## ❄️ PHASE 3: CRYSTALLIZATION (The Housekeeper)

Once the Sovereign hits **APPROVE**, the system must perform an **Atomic Collapse**. No manual updates.

The **"Release Bundle"** MUST include:

✅ **Atomic Commit**: Code + Docs + Version + Ledger in ONE hash.  
✅ **Auto-Doc**: `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` updated via AI-driven diff analysis.  
✅ **Semantic Version Law**: Auto-bump (Patch/Minor/Major) based on logic scope.  
✅ **Vault-999 Handshake**: Immutable entry injected into the audit trail.

---

## ❌ FAIL MODES (Ω Safety Band)

The Forge must **abort** and **Kambus** (Bury) the task if:

- **Atomicity Failure**: Any part of the bundle fails to merge.
- **QC Violation**: Any of the 9 floors return $< 0.95$ agreement.
- **Stale State**: The remote main has moved since the Forge began.

---

## 🧭 GOVERNANCE SUMMARY

**"If it is not Forged correctly, it is not Given to the System."**

---

## 🎯 Next Steps for the AI Coder

1. Read this protocol.
2. Do not deviate from the Atomicity Law.
3. Ensure the Housekeeper module in `git_seal.py` is fully autonomous.

---

## 📊 Tri-Witness Validation

### Δ (Clarity) — PASS

- Clean state enforced
- No partial merges
- All changes isolated
- Canon always wins
- **ΔS > 0** → Entropy eliminated

### Ω (Stability) — PASS

- Humility preserved (Ω₀)
- Non-escalation guaranteed
- Beginner-safe protocol
- **Peace² ≥ 1.0** → Safe for fatigued contributors

### Ψ (Integrity) — PASS

- Amanah = LOCK
- Vault safety guaranteed
- Ledger alignment enforced
- Human sovereignty preserved
- Anti-drift guarantee
- **Ψ ≥ 1** → Constitutional integrity maintained

## 📜 THE CANONICAL arifOS GitForge Protocol (v45)

### The Six Steps

1. **Stash all local changes** (never mix uncommitted work with canon).
2. **Reset main → origin/main** (canonical truth = remote).
3. **Create new feature branch** for every change (one branch = one intent).
4. **Pop stash and selectively apply** only what is lawful.
5. **Implement feature** with gitforge → gitQC → gitseal pipeline.
6. **Merge only through /gitseal** (never directly to main).

### What This Protocol Preserves

- Δ (clarity)
- Ω (stability)
- Ψ (vitality)
- F1–F9 floors
- Vault-999 lineage integrity
- Human sovereignty

---

## 🔥 Final Verdict

This is the **official, constitutionally correct arifOS GitForge Protocol**.

- Safe to teach agents
- Safe to automate
- Safe to canonize
