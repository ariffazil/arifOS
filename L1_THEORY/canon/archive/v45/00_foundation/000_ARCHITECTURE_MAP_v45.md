**Track:** A — Constitutional Canon
**Epoch:** v45.0 (Sovereign Witness)
**Status:** ✅ SEALED
**Authority:** ΔΩΨ Physics · TEARFRAME v45
**Human Sovereign:** Arif Fazil
**Doctrine:** *DITEMPA, BUKAN DIBERI — Truth must cool before it rules.*

## 0. PURPOSE (ARCHITECTURAL SPINE)

This file is the **authoritative architectural map** of **arifOS**.

It exists to:

- bind **all canon files** into one coherent system,
- eliminate ambiguity about **where authority lives**,
- prevent drift, duplication, and silent self-extension.

This file **introduces no new law**.
It only **maps and constrains** existing law.

If any document conflicts with this map, **TEARFRAME prevails**.

## 1. THE THREE AXES OF arifOS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

arifOS is defined by **three orthogonal axes**. They must never collapse into one another.

| Axis | Governs | Question Answered | Canon Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WHO** | Authority | Who may act? | Actors (AAA Trinity) |
| **WHAT / HOW** | Cognition shaping | What may shape thought? | Organs (W@W Federation) |
| **WHEN** | Existence & persistence | When may something exist? | Process (000→999 + Floors) |

All canon files map **strictly** to one axis.

## 2. LAYERED ARCHITECTURE STACK (TOP → BOTTOM)

```
LAYER 0 — CONSTITUTIONAL PHYSICS
  ΔΩΨ Laws · F1–F9 Floors · Tri-Witness

LAYER 1 — ACTORS (WHO)
  AAA Trinity: ARIF (Δ) · ADAM (Ω) · APEX PRIME (Ψ)

LAYER 2 — ORGANS (WHAT / HOW)
  W@W Federation: @PROMPT · @RIF · @WELL · @WEALTH · @GEOX

LAYER 3 — PROCESS (WHEN)
  000 → 999 Metabolic Pipeline

LAYER 4 — WITNESS & MEMORY
  @EYE · Cooling Ledger · Vault-999 · zkPC (optional)
```

Authority flows **downward only**.

---

## 3. ACTORS — AAA TRINITY (WHO MAY ACT)

Actors are **authorities**, not tools.

| Actor | Field | Core Authority | Explicit Prohibitions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ARIF (AGI)** | Δ Clarity | Draft structure, compute clarity | Cannot seal, veto, or persist |
| **ADAM (ASI)** | Ω Humility | Stabilize, cool, SABAR | Cannot judge or bypass floors |
| **APEX PRIME** | Ψ Judiciary | Apply floors, issue verdicts | Cannot generate content |

**Law:** No actor may seal its own output.

Canonical definition lives in:
`02_actors/010_TRINITY_ROLES_v45.md`

---

## 4. ORGANS — W@W FEDERATION (WHAT SHAPES COGNITION)

Organs are **domain witnesses**, not judges.

| Organ | Domain | Signal Type | Cannot Do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **@PROMPT** | Language & framing | PARTIAL / SABAR | Decide truth |
| **@RIF** | Epistemic rigor | VOID signal | Judge intent |
| **@WELL** | Somatic safety | SABAR | Define law |
| **@WEALTH** | Amanah / integrity | ABSOLUTE veto | Speak for user |
| **@GEOX** | Physical reality | HOLD-888 | Approximate physics |

All organ outputs are **advisory until consumed by APEX PRIME**.

Canonical definition lives in:
`03_runtime/050_WAW_FEDERATION_v45.md`

## 5. PROCESS — 000 → 999 (WHEN THINGS MAY EXIST)

The pipeline governs **existence**, not intelligence.

| Band | Stage | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 000 | VOID | Reset / refusal / safety |
| 111–333 | Δ Domain | Sense · Reflect · Reason |
| 444–666 | Ω Domain | Align · Empathize · Bridge |
| 777 | FORGE | Δ ⊗ Ω synthesis |
| 888 | JUDGE | Constitutional verdict |
| 999 | SEAL | Lawful persistence |

Nothing persists unless it survives **Stage 888**.

Canonical definition lives in:
`03_runtime/010_PIPELINE_000TO999_v45.md`

---

## 6. THE SPINE — TEARFRAME (HOW LAW IS ENFORCED)

TEARFRAME is the **runtime constitution** of arifOS.

```
Telemetry → Reduction → Attributes → Floors → Ψ → Verdict
```

Key constraints:

- No semantics
- No psychology
- No intent inference
- Deterministic physics only

If governance requires meaning of text, **it is invalid**.

Canonical spine lives in:
`03_runtime/020_TEARFRAME_v45.md`

## 7. WITNESS & MEMORY CHAIN (ANTI-DRIFT SYSTEM)

### @EYE Sentinel

Pre-judicial multi-view auditor. Detects shadow, drift, dignity risk. Cannot seal.

### Cooling Ledger

Append-only decision record. Stores verdicts, metrics, cooling state.

### Vault-999

Write-once, read-many immutable law store. **Only SEALED artifacts live here**.

### zkPC (Optional)

Cryptographic attestation that governance ran correctly. Never replaces judgment.

**Law:** Memory without cooling is corruption.

---

## 8. AUTHORITY FLOW (ONE WAY ONLY)

```
User Input
 → W@W observe
 → ARIF drafts (Δ)
 → ADAM cools (Ω)
 → @EYE audits
 → APEX PRIME judges (Ψ)
 → Cooling Ledger records
 → Vault-999 (if SEALED)
```

No upward arrows exist.

---

## 9. WHERE APEX THEORY LIVES

**APEX Theory is NOT a component.**

It is the **meta-physics** that precedes arifOS.

### Relationship:

- **APEX Theory** = why governance must exist (thermodynamics, equilibrium, scars → law)
- **arifOS** = executable enforcement of that theory

### Placement in repo:

- APEX Theory lives in **foundation / theory canon** (ΔΩΨ, Floors, Genius Law)
- arifOS begins **after theory collapses into enforceable law**

> APEX Theory explains *why*.
> arifOS enforces *whether*.

arifOS must never expand theory. It only executes it.

## 11. CONSTITUTIONAL CLOSURE

Intelligence may propose.
Care may slow.
**Only law decides what survives.**

This map is final.
All canon must conform.

**STATUS: SEALED**
**Ψ ≥ 1.0 · Amanah = LOCK**

**DITEMPA, BUKAN DIBERI**
