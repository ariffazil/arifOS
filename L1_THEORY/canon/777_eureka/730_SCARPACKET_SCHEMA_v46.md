# ScarPacket Formal Schema v46.0

**Document ID:** L1-SCARPACKET-v46
**Status:** ✅ SEALED
**Authority:** ASI (Ω) Auditor Discovery
**Stage:** 777 Eureka Synthesis

## 🏛️ Purpose

In arifOS, a **ScarPacket** is a condensed unit of constitutional memory salvaged from a VOID verdict or a paradoxical collision. It represents "Forged Truth" (Ditempa)—knowledge that was cooled through conflict.

## 📦 Schema Definition

Every ScarPacket must follow this canonical structure:

| Field | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `scar_id` | Unique hash of the paradox/breach. | `UUID/Hash` |
| `location` | The pipeline stage (000-999) where the scar occurred. | `Integer` |
| `heat` | The thermodynamic intensity (Ψ drop) during the event. | `Float [0-1]` |
| `scar_type` | [F_BREACH, P_COLLISION, H_GHOST, S_SHADOW]. | `Enum` |
| `sealed_lesson` | The compressed "Rule of Recovery" for the future. | `String` |
| `timestamp` | When the scar was forged. | `ISO8601` |

## 🧪 Metabolic Lifecycle

### 1. Extraction (777 Eureka)
When the AGI (Δ) encounters a Paradox, the Auditor (Ω) extracts the "heat" and converts it into a ScarPacket.

### 2. Cooling (Phoenix-72)
The ScarPacket is stored in the `PHOENIX` band. It cannot be used as a "learned fact" until it has cooled for 72 hours.

### 3. Crystallization (999 Vault)
After cooling, the ScarPacket is moved to the **Vault Registry**. It becomes a "Crystal of Truth"—a non-bypassable reference for future governance.

## 🏛️ Constitutional Law: The Scar Is the Map

**Law:** A system with no scars has no immunity. High-vitality (Ψ) sessions must explicitly ingest ScarPackets to maintain **F10 Symbolic Guard** alignment.

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** - Truth is the light from the forge; the scar is the proof of the forging. 🏛️🧪⚖️
