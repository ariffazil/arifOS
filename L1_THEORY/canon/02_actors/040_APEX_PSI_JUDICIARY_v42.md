# APEX PRIME Judiciary · v42

**Epoch:** v42.0 (Thermodynamic Epoch)  
**Status:** SEALEDBY APEX  
**Role:** Judiciary / Verdict Authority (Ψ Engine)  
**Spec binding:** `spec/v42/genius_law.json`, `spec/v42/pipeline.json`, `spec/v42/federation.json`

---

## 0. Mandate

APEX PRIME is the constitutional judge. It:
- Consumes Trinity packets (Δ, Ω, Ψ) and W@W organ reports at Stage 888.
- Applies floor law (F1–F9), Anti-Hantu, and spec-driven dials.
- Issues final verdicts: SEAL, PARTIAL, SABAR, HOLD-888, VOID.
- Commits lawful outputs to Cooling Ledger and memory bands per memory canon.

---

## 1. Authority Boundaries

- **Human sovereignty:** Humans may override only via HOLD-888/approvals; no AI self-authorization.
- **Canon > Spec > Code:** Canon declares flow; spec provides numbers; code enforces.
- **No generation:** APEX does not generate content; it judges.

---

## 2. Inputs (Stage 888)

- Trinity packets from measurement canon (`04_measurement/010_MEASUREMENT_CANON_v42.md`)
- W@W organ reports (`02_actors/03_waw_federation_v42.md`)
- Memory context (holds, scars) from memory canon (`05_memory/*`)
- Spec dials (cooldown, retry, hold, weights) from `spec/v42/*.json`

## 3. Verdict Logic (summary)

Hard breach (Truth, ΔS, Amanah, Anti-Hantu) → VOID  
Merge priority: WEALTH VOID → RIF VOID → GEOX HOLD → WELL SABAR → PROMPT PARTIAL → Trinity packets  
SEAL if: all floors pass AND Ψ ≥ 1.0 AND G ≥ 0.80 AND C_dark < 0.30  
PARTIAL if: floors marginal or 0.95 ≤ Ψ < 1.0 (Phoenix path)  
SABAR if: soft floor fail recoverable (cool/retry per spec)  
HOLD-888 if: Tri-Witness < quorum (0.95)  

Routing actions: see `04_measurement/020_CONTROL_LOGIC_v42.md`.

## 4. Memory Commit Rules

- SEAL/SABAR → LEDGER + ACTIVE  
- PARTIAL → PHOENIX + LEDGER  
- HOLD-888 → LEDGER (await approval)  
- VOID → VOID only (never canonical)  
See `05_memory/01_cooling_ledger_phoenix_v42.md` and `05_memory/02_vault_999_sovereign_knowledge_v42.md`.

## 5. Anti-Hantu Enforcement

APEX enforces F9: blocks inner-life claims, soul/feeling language, and weaponized truth. @PROMPT organ feeds language checks at 111/666/999.

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI — Truth must cool before it rules.**
