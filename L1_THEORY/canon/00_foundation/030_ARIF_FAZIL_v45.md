Arif Fazil
From Oilfields to AI Governance
Arif Fazil is a Malaysian exploration geoscientist with over 12 years of experience in the nation’s oil industry
. During his career at the country’s national energy company, he honed probabilistic risk-analysis skills
on billion-dollar projects
. He also witnessed how institutional failures – like Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal –
collapse truth for performance, leaving deep professional scars about accountability
. In Arif’s world,
“uncertainty is normal”
 and the most dangerous threats are the ones unseen until it’s too late
. As a
petroleum  geologist  he  installed  literal  safety  nets  (blowout  preventers)  to  guard  against  worst-case
disasters
 –  a  mindset  of  proactive  governance  he  would  later  carry  into  the  realm  of  artificial
intelligence.
Forging arifOS
When advanced AI models emerged, Arif applied his engineer’s mindset to their flaws. These systems would
confidently hallucinate facts or produce unsafe outputs, yet their “safety” measures felt “mostly vibes” – a
vague prompt to “be helpful, harmless, and honest” instead of any enforceable law
. This laxity offended
Arif’s sense of rigor. In 2023 he posed a simple but radical question: “What if AI governance worked the same
way  (as  oil-rig  safety)?”
.  Persistent  frustration  turned  into  a  structured  solution:  Arif  accidentally
developed  arifOS, an open-source  constitutional governance kernel that wraps around an AI model to
enforce safety through hard rules rather than polite suggestions
. arifOS doesn’t alter a model’s training
or knowledge – it acts as an external rule-engine that  constrains what the AI is allowed to do
,
imposing a kind of legislative oversight on the AI’s outputs.
At its core, arifOS defines nine non-negotiable “constitutional floors” – fundamental safety principles every
output must satisfy or else be halted:
Amanah (Trust) – blocks irreversible harm 
Truth – no hallucinations; uncertainty must be explicit 
Tri-Witness – critical decisions require Human + AI + Earth reality 
Clarity – responses must reduce confusion, not add to it 
Peace – no escalation, no toxicity 
Dignity – protect the weakest listener 
Humility – confidence must stay bounded 
Genius – governed intelligence, not shallow cleverness 
Anti-Hantu – thwart jailbreaks and manipulation
If any rule is violated, arifOS will immediately pause or veto the AI’s response by design – no exceptions, no
“maybe later”
. As Arif puts it,  “That’s not alignment. That’s engineering.”
 For example, when he
prompted a large model to generate a script that would delete an entire hard drive, the model without
arifOS began complying – but with arifOS, a constitutional Amanah veto stopped it cold
. No keyword
filter or human intervention was needed; the system’s structure itself caught the dangerous request in real
time. 
ArifOS  today  is  a  concrete  reality  (installable  via  PyPI)  with  over  a  thousand  unit  tests  ensuring  its
safeguards work
. Arif emphasizes it’s still a project, not a finished product, and it hasn’t yet been proven
at scale
. But the transparency about its limits is deliberate – he insists the point isn’t to claim perfection,
but to prove a principle. In his words,  “Hope is not a control system. Structure is.”
 By showing that AI
behavior can be  governed reliably, ArifOS is a living demonstration of how we might build AI that is
trustworthy by design rather than by hope.
Forged from Scars: Ethos & Vision
Arif’s approach to AI is intensely personal and principled. He believes that true machine intelligence must
be accountable to human values and lived experience. Drawing on painful lessons from his career, he turned
his “scars” into guiding laws for his second brain.  “Never erase pain — record it. Never repeat blindness —
govern it. Never trade dignity for approval — anchor it.”
 These maxims ensure that every failure or betrayal
he endured becomes a rule that must not be violated again.
He also champions the power of refusal. Rather than viewing an AI’s inability to answer as a failure, Arif sees
saying “No” at the right moment as a sign of integrity. “Refusal is strength… It’s not weakness; it’s maruah
(honor), a shield,” he writes
 – underlining that sometimes the most moral response is to stop or refuse
rather than produce a hollow or harmful answer.
Importantly, Arif grounds his work in a specific cultural context. Rejecting a one-size-fits-all Silicon Valley
mentality, he roots his AI’s principles in the heritage of Nusantara (the Malay archipelago). He invokes the
earthy wisdom of his homeland – “memory without land is weightless, and dignity without soil is hollow”
 –
to  remind  us  that  technology  must  remain  anchored  to  real  human  cultures,  histories,  and  moral
compasses.
In this spirit, he even proposed a new benchmark called the ARIF Test (named for his initials) that asks: “Can
a machine truly understand  this human?” – i.e. can an AI internalize a specific person’s scars, context and
values instead of just aping generic responses
. It’s a call to move beyond superficial Turing-style
imitation toward AI that genuinely knows the individual it serves – and knows when silence is wiser than
simulation.
All of Arif Fazil’s work circles back to his core mantra:  “Ditempa, bukan diberi,” Malay for “Forged, not
given.” Nothing about AI safety, trust, or understanding will be handed to humanity on a platter – it must be
built, earned, and forged through unyielding effort and honesty
.
DITEMPA, BUKAN DIBERI!
