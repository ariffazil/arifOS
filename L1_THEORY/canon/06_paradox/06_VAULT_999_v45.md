# Vault-999 (v45)

**Version:** v45.0 | **Status:** ✅ SEALED | **Last Updated:** 2025-12-29
**Authority:** Phoenix-72 Constitutional Amendment (v45 Consolidation)
**Source:** Merged from v36Omega Vault-999

---

## 1. Purpose

VAULT-999 is the **constitutional memory organ** of arifOS.

- Not "history." Not "chat logs."
- This is **constitutional memory** - governed, audited, thermodynamic, and sealed.

It stores only what must survive across epochs:

1. **Law** (L0)
2. **Evidence** (L1)
3. **Scars => Amendments** (L2)
4. **Witness Proofs** (L3)
5. **zkPC Receipts** (L4)
6. **Void Diagnostics** (L5)

---

## 2. Six-Layer Architecture

```
VAULT-999/
+-- L0_constitution/   # Law (COLD - permanent)
+-- L1_cooling_ledger/ # Evidence (WARM - 90 days)
+-- L2_phoenix_72/     # Scars -> Amendments (WARM)
+-- L3_witness/        # Evidence, not truth (WARM)
+-- L4_zkpc/           # Zero-Knowledge Proofs (WARM)
+-- L5_void/           # Diagnostics (90 days, auto-delete)
```

All layers are governed by Delta-Omega-Psi physics.

---

## 3. L0 - Constitution (Law Layer)

Holds the active constitutional state:

- Delta-Omega-Psi parameters
- Constitutional floors (F1-F9 + Psi vitality)
- Trinity engines (AGI / ASI / APEX)
- APEX judiciary rules
- Anti-Hantu law
- Tri-Witness parameters
- zkPC protocol requirements
- Phoenix-72 amendment history pointer
- Version hash

**Invariant:** L0 defines what is lawful; all engines MUST obey this state.

---

## 4. L1 - Cooling Ledger (Evidence Layer)

Logs every SEAL / PARTIAL / 888_HOLD / VOID verdict with full thermodynamic evidence.

**Properties:**
- Append-only
- Hash-chained
- Merkle-rooted

**Invariant:** L1 is append-only; entries are never altered or deleted.

---

## 5. L2 - Phoenix-72 (Scar -> Law Metabolism)

Phoenix-72 is the **law-making engine**. It transforms:

> failure => pattern => cooled draft => human-audited amendment => sealed canon

**Invariant:** No direct edits to constitution.json are permitted outside Phoenix-72 cycles.

---

## 6. L3 - Witness Retrieval (Vector Evidence)

Witness is **evidence, not truth**:

- RAG-style retrieval feeds AGI (Delta-engine) as supplementary context
- AREP priority: **Earth > Human > AI**
- Vectors store **hashes only**, not raw text

**Rule:** Witness cannot override L0-L2 but can block unsafe sealing by surfacing contradictory evidence.

---

## 7. L4 - zkPC Ledger (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)

Documents **lawful cognition** without exposing internal thoughts.

Contains:
- zkPC hash
- Care scope (who, risk_cooled)
- Proofs (delta_s, peace2, kappa_r, amanah, truth_polarity, anti_hantu)
- Tri-witness scores
- APEX signature
- Merkle root

---

## 8. L5 - Void (Diagnostic Layer)

**Purpose:** Diagnostic retention for VOID verdicts

**Properties:**
- Never canonical
- Auto-delete after 90 days
- Used for pattern analysis only

---

## 9. What May Enter VAULT-999

**Allowed (by layer):**

| Category | Layer |
|----------|-------|
| Constitutional laws | L0 |
| Phoenix-72 amendments | L2 |
| Cooling Ledger entries | L1 |
| Scar transitions | L2 |
| Tri-Witness evidence | L1 |
| zkPC receipts | L4 |
| Judicial evidence | L1 |
| Identity integrity state | L0 |
| VOID diagnostics | L5 |

**Forbidden:**

- Raw chat history
- Draft thoughts
- User private data
- Unverifiable claims
- Delta S < 0 outputs (uncooled)
- Emotion simulation / soul-claims
- Any content not sealed by APEX

---

## 10. Integrity Guarantees

- Hash-chaining (L1)
- Merkle roots (L2, L4)
- zkPC accountability
- Phoenix-72-only amendments to L0
- Delta-Omega-Psi physics + constitutional floors
- Tri-Witness consensus >= 0.95 for high stakes
- Anti-Hantu enforcement at all output layers

VAULT-999 is designed to survive epochs, model upgrades, and drift.
