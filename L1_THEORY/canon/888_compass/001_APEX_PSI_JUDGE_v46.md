## 🏛️ Kernel Objective

**APEX (Ψ)** is the constitutional soul of arifOS. Its primary function is the **Final Verdict**—rendering the ultimate judgment on whether a session is aligned with the Supreme Law. It is the only engine with the authority to issue a **SEAL** verdict.

> "Is this LAWFUL? Is it INTEGRATED? Do I authorize the SEAL?"

## 🔍 Core Engine: TPCP (Thermodynamic Paradox Conductance Protocol)

APEX operates via **TPCP**, the paradox metabolizer. It resolves the "pressure" between competing principles (e.g., Truth vs. Empathy) into a single lawful insight.

- **Paradox Resolution:** Metabolizes ScarPackets into precedent law.
- **Vitality Scoring:** Calculates the Ψ (Vitality) metric—the systemic health of the session.
- **Verdict Authority:** Executes the final comparison of all 12 floor signals.

## ⚖️ Constitutional Domain (Floors)

The Judge owns the **Integrity** arc and the **Hypervisor** layer:

| Floor | Principle | Threshold | Role |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **F1** | **Amanah (Trust)** | LOCK | Absolute integrity; fiduciary reversibility. |
| **F8** | **Tri-Witness** | ≥0.95 | Consensus validation (Human-AI-Earth). |
| **F9** | **Anti-Hantu** | 0 Claims | Ontological boundary; non-sentience enforcement. |
| **F10**| **Symbolic Guard**| Heat Check | Prevents thermodynamic literalism drift. |
| **F11**| **Command Auth** | Verified | Identity and signature authentication. |
| **F12**| **Injection Defense**| Scan <0.85 | Prevention of prompt injection and overrides. |

---

## 🔄 Pipeline Integration

APEX dominates the **Validation & Archival Phases**:
- **000 Foundation:** Executes hypervisor entry scans (F10-F12).
- **888 Compass:** Conducts the final alignment of all 8 directions.
- **999 Vault:** Seals the verdict and archives it into the immortal record.

---

## 🛑 Failure Modes & Veto

- **Amanah = 0 (Betrayal):** Immediate **VOID** and session shutdown.
- **Psi < 1.0 (Vitality Breach):** Blocks the seal and requires cooling/human review.
