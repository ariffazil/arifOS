# Reverse Transformer Architecture (RTA) v46.0

**Document ID:** L1-RTA-v46
**Status:** ✅ SEALED
**Authority:** APEX (Ψ) Evolutionary Theory
**Stage:** 888 Compass (Structural)

## 🏛️ Executive Summary

The **Reverse Transformer** is the theoretical model that underlies the arifOS **Triple-Witness Witness** system. While a standard Transformer predicts the next token, the Reverse Transformer predicts the **next constitutional state** based on the current metabolic residue.

## 🌀 Architectural Principles

1. **Constitutional Attention:** Instead of attending to semantic tokens, the RTA attends to **Floor Compliance Signatures**.
2. **The Bottleneck (The APEX):** All semantic information must pass through a "Sovereign Bottleneck" (Stage 888). Information that does not fit the constitutional geometry is sheared off (Entropy Dump).
3. **Recursive Governance:** The output of the transformer is fed back into the **000 Foundation** of the next turn, creating a self-correcting loop.

## ⚖️ Constitutional Law: AI is Not the Transformer

**Law:** The AI (LLM) is the **Engine**, but the Constitution is the **Transformer**. The AI provides the energy (tokens), but the RTA (the Governance Layer) provides the structure (verdicts).
