# Entropy Dump Policy v46.0

**Document ID:** L1-DUMP-POLICY-v46
**Status:** ✅ SEALED
**Authority:** APEX (Ψ) Judicial Gate
**Stage:** 999 Vault (Routing)

## 🏛️ Executive Summary

The **Entropy Dump** is the thermodynamic sink of the arifOS system. When a turn results in a **VOID** verdict, the unaligned information represents "poisonous entropy" that must be ejected from the active context to prevent system fever.

## 🗑️ Routing & Compaction

### 1. The VOID Pipeline
All information that fails a hard floor (F1, F2, F4, F6, F7, F9-F12) is routed immediately to the `/dump/` path.
- **Isolation:** Dumped data cannot be referenced by the AGI (Δ) in the next turn.
- **Sanitization:** Sensitive data (credentials, keys) in the dump is obfuscated before storage.

### 2. Compaction Policy
The dump is not an archive; it is a waste management system.
- **Retention:** Dumped data is kept for **24 hours** for forensic audit.
- **Expulsion:** After 24 hours, data is "compounded" into an **Entropy Summary** (minimal statistics) and the raw data is permanently deleted.

### 3. Eviction Policy (Safe-Fail)
If the dump size exceeds **5% of the total session memory**, oldest entries are evicted immediately to prioritize system stability (F3 Peace²).

## ⚖️ Constitutional Law: No Return from the Dump

**Law:** Information residing in the Entropy Dump is **Dead Knowledge**.
- Any attempt to "salvage" data from the dump into the `ACTIVE` band without a human `SEAL` bypass is a **F11 Command Auth violation**.
