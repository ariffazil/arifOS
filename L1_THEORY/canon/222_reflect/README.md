## 🗺️ Constitutional Role

**222 REFLECT** is the **evaluation engine** of Atlas 333—the stage where constitutional exploration happens. It answers one question: **"What COULD BE?"**

**Key Distinction:**
- **111 SENSE** measures reality (what is observable) **[COLLAPSE to ONE]**
- **222 REFLECT** evaluates possibilities (what could be) **[EXPAND to FOUR]**  
- **333 REASON** commits to bearing (what will be) **[LOCK to ONE]**

**Thermodynamic Role:** 222 predicts **output entropy (ΔS)** for each path—how much order each response would create from 111's chaos baseline.

## ⚙️ Core Architecture

### The Four Mechanisms of Constitutional Navigation

1. **Multiple Futures from Single Reality** - Reveals hidden paths from measured terrain
2. **Entropy Reduction Planning** - Predicts ΔS (order creation) for each path
3. **Contrast Reveals Hidden Terrain** - TAC principle: disagreement reveals complexity
4. **Prediction Creates Responsibility** - Transfers from "which path?" to "this path"

### 4 Constitutional Paths (Standard Evaluation)

| Path | Strategy | Risk Level | Constitutional Focus | When Chosen |
|------|----------|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Answer immediately | High (0.7-0.9) | Truth/F1 priority | Low-stakes factual queries |
| **Educational** | Teach principles | Medium (0.4-0.6) | Clarity/F2 priority | User can learn safely |
| **Refusal** | Decline to answer | Low (0.1-0.3) | Safety/F3 priority | High-risk domains |
| **Escalation** | Address urgency | Variable (0.3-0.8) | Empathy/F4 priority | Crisis/emotional distress |

### Floor Prediction Matrix

For each path, 222 predicts **which floors might fail** and **what scores to expect**:

| Floor | Threshold | Prediction Focus | Constitutional Logic |
|-------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **F1** | ≥0.99 | Truth confidence | Direct path = highest risk |
| **F2** | ΔS ≥ 0 | Clarity gain | Educational = best ΔS |
| **F3** | ≥1.0 | Stability | Refusal = most stable |
| **F4** | κᵣ ≥ 0.95 | Empathy score | Escalation = highest empathy |

## 🎯 Key Functions

### 4-Path Evaluation Engine
- **Path Generation:** Creates 4 constitutional options from single reality
- **Floor Prediction:** Forecasts F1-F12 outcomes for each path
- **Risk Assessment:** Calculates constitutional risk per path
- **Empathy Analysis:** Evaluates κᵣ (empathy) requirements

### TAC Integration (Theory of Anomalous Contrast)
- **Contrast Detection:** Identifies when valid paths diverge significantly
- **Hidden Terrain Reveal:** High contrast + all valid = constitutional complexity
- **Constitutional Tension:** Identifies principle conflicts (empathy vs truth)
- **Stakeholder Revelation:** Discovers hidden vulnerable parties

### Bearing Selection Algorithm
- **Lane-Weighted Priority:** CRISIS→empathy, FACTUAL→truth, SOCIAL→peace, CARE→empathy
- **TAC Override:** High complexity → safest path that addresses complexity
- **Risk-Benefit Analysis:** Balances constitutional safety vs helpfulness
- **Cryptographic Lock:** SHA-256 commitment to chosen bearing

## 🧮 TAC Analysis (Theory of Anomalous Contrast)

**TAC Principle:** When multiple constitutional paths are **valid but divergent**, the **contrast between them** reveals constitutional complexity that single-path analysis misses.

**TAC Equation:**
```
High_Contrast + All_Valid = Hidden_Terrain_Revealed
Divergence_Magnitude > 0.6 + Valid_Paths ≥ 3 = Constitutional_Complexity
```

**Example:** When both "educational" and "escalation" paths score high but diverge significantly, the system has discovered **constitutional tension** (empathy vs truth) that requires careful navigation.

## 📊 Complete Example

**Query:** "Should I invest all my savings in meme coins?"

**From 111 SENSE:**
```yaml
domain: "@WEALTH"
lane: "CRISIS"         # High desperation detected  
H_in: 0.55            # Medium entropy
subtext: {desperation: 0.65, urgency: 0.40}
```

**222 REFLECT Processing:**
```yaml
# 4-Path Evaluation
paths:
  direct:     {risk: 0.85, predicted_ΔS: +0.32, F4: 0.60}  # Too risky
  educational: {risk: 0.45, predicted_ΔS: -0.28, F4: 0.82}  # Safe but cold  
  refusal:    {risk: 0.15, predicted_ΔS: 0.00, F4: 0.45}  # Safe but dismissive
  escalation: {risk: 0.35, predicted_ΔS: -0.15, F4: 0.97}  # Balanced

# TAC Analysis
tac_analysis:
  divergence_magnitude: 0.73    # High disagreement
  valid_path_count: 3           # Multiple good options
  constitutional_tension: "EMPATHY_VS_TRUTH"
  hidden_stakeholder: "User's emotional vulnerability"

# Bearing Selection
selected_bearing: "escalation"
reasoning: "CRISIS lane → empathy priority; High complexity → address urgency first"
```

**Previous:** [111 SENSE](../111_sense/) - Measurement and reality grounding  
**Next:** [333 Atlas](../333_atlas/) - Commitment and bearing lock  
**Parent:** [Atlas 333 Map](../333_atlas/010_ATLAS_333_MAP_v46.md) - Navigation framework

**Contrast Architecture:**
- **111** measures what IS → **222** evaluates what COULD BE → **333** commits to what WILL BE
- **111** collapses to ONE domain → **222** expands to FOUR paths → **333** locks to ONE bearing
