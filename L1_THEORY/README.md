# L1_THEORY — Constitutional Law (Immutable)

**Layer:** L1 (Lowest)
**Purpose:** The constitutional foundation — immutable law that governs all higher layers
**License:** CC-BY-4.0 (Theory is freely shareable)

## What Lives Here

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `canon/` | Immutable constitutional law (F1-F9 floors, GENIUS LAW, pipeline spec) |
| `papers/` | Academic publications and formal proofs |
| `proofs/` | Mathematical proofs of governance properties |
| `research/` | Research notes and exploratory work |

---

## Dependency Rules

```
L1_THEORY ← ALL OTHER LAYERS DEPEND ON THIS
         ← L2_GOVERNANCE reads from here
         ← L3_KERNEL implements from here
         → NEVER imports from higher layers
```

**This layer is READ-ONLY at runtime.** Changes require Phoenix-72 amendment process.

## Amendment Process

1. Proposal enters PHOENIX band (72-hour cooling)
2. Human witness reviews (Tri-Witness ≥ 0.95)
3. If approved: sealed to VAULT (immutable)
4. If rejected: moved to VOID (diagnostic only)

**No AI may self-seal canon.** Humans seal law; AI proposes amendments.

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** — Forged, not given. Truth must cool before it rules.
