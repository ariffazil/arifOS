├── 000_CANON_2_ARCHITECTURE.md    (topology)

## Why Deprecated?

**v49 is strictly superior:**
- More floors (13 vs 9)
- Better structure (trilogy vs scattered)
- Clearer governance (stage enforcement)
- Complete specs (Track A/B/C aligned)

**No unique value in L1_THEORY** that isn't already in v49.
