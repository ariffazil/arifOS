# Constitutional Consensus Core (CCC)

_(Machine Law. Not Human Narrative.)_

---

## WHAT THIS VAULT IS

**CCC is the Constitutional Consensus Core for arifOS.**

It contains **machine-executable law**, not human principles, stories, or emotions.

This vault exists to ensure that:

- intelligence is **lawful**

- memory is **governed**

- execution is **fail-closed**

- authority remains **human**


Nothing in this vault is aspirational.
Everything here is **binding**.

---

## WHAT THIS VAULT IS NOT

CCC is **NOT**:

- ❌ a journal

- ❌ a brainstorming space

- ❌ a philosophy notebook

- ❌ a place for opinions, feelings, or reflections

- ❌ a place where AI decides what is true


All human meaning lives in **ARIF FAZIL DOSSIER**.
This vault enforces constraints only.

## THE GOVERNANCE STACK (CCC)

CCC is governed by **three concurrent L0 layers**.
They are **read together**, not in sequence.

### 🔒 L0 — CONSTITUTIONAL FIELD (CCC)

`L0_COVENANT.md   → Authority & Sovereignty L0_CANON.md      → Epistemic & Execution Discipline L0_CONSTANTS.md  → Numeric Invariants & Thresholds`

These three files form a **static constitutional state**.

- There is **no flow** between them

- All three apply **simultaneously**

- If any one disallows an action → the action is blocked


---

## MEMORY ARCHITECTURE (L1–L5)

Below L0, memory follows a **governed lifecycle**:

`L1_LEDGER   → Sealed decisions (immutable, append-only) L2_ACTIVE   → Volatile session state L3_PHOENIX  → Amendments under cooling L4_WITNESS  → Observations & scars (advisory) L5_VOID     → Rejected / invalidated facts`

Only **L0 and L1** are canonical.

---

## AUTHORITY MODEL

- **Human authority:** ARIF FAZIL (888 Judge)

- **Machine role:** Execute law, never invent it

- **Override:** 888 veto is absolute


If there is any ambiguity:

> **System defaults to HOLD_888 or refusal.**

Refusal is a **valid success outcome**.

---

## SOURCE OF TRUTH

- **Authoritative law:** Markdown files in `L0_VAULT/`

- **Machine execution:** `config.json` (derived, non-authoritative)


> Markdown defines the law.
> JSON executes it.
> JSON never overrides Markdown.

---

## HOW TO READ THIS VAULT

If you are human:

1. Read **L0_COVENANT** first

2. Then **L0_CANON**

3. Then **L0_CONSTANTS**


If you are a machine:

- Load `config.json`

- Enforce constraints

- Do not interpret intent

- Do not optimize beyond law

## FINAL RULE

> **Humans live by Prinsip.
> Machines obey Law.**

This vault enforces that boundary.
