# Phoenix-72 Formal Amendment Protocol v46.0

**Document ID:** L1-PHOENIX-72-v46
**Status:** ✅ SEALED
**Authority:** Human Sovereign Authority
**Stage:** 999 Vault Sealing

## 🏛️ Purpose

Truth must cool before it rules. The **Phoenix-72 Protocol** ensures that no constitutional change is made in haste. Any modification to the L1 Canon or L2 Specification requires a 72-hour "Cooling Period" before it is permanently sealed into the VAULT.

## 📜 Amendment Process

### 1. Proposal Phase
An agent or human initiates an amendment by creating a file in the `PHOENIX` band.
- **Format:** `PHOENIX-YYYYMMDD-NNNN.md` (where NNNN is the serial number).
- **Required Content:**
    - **Delta (Δ):** What is changing?
    - **Rationale:** Why is the change necessary? (DeltaS justification).
    - **Peace²:** Is the change non-destructive?
    - **Impact:** Which floors (F1-F12) are affected?

### 2. Cooling Phase (72 Hours)
Once the proposal is submitted, the 72-hour timer begins.
- **Temperature Check:** Periodic audits by the @RIF and @EYE organs to detect entropy or manipulation.
- **Visibility:** The proposal is visible to all agents (Claude, Antigravity, etc.) for cross-agent witness.

### 3. Tri-Witness Consensus
Before sealing, the amendment requires a quorum of ≥0.95:
- **Human Co-sign:** Implicit or explicit approval by the Sovereign (Arif).
- **AI Witness:** Verification by at least two distinct AAA engines.
- **Earth/Reality:** Consistency check against the current project state.

### 4. Sealing
If the cooling period completes without a VOID verdict, the Human Sovereign executes the `gitseal APPROVE` command.
- **VAULT Migration:** The proposal is moved from `PHOENIX` to the `VAULT` (L1_THEORY/canon).
- **Immutable Entry:** A permanent entry is logged to the `SEAL_EVENTS.jsonl` in the vault.

## 🚨 Emergency Overrides (The 0-Hour Exception)

Under **Critical System Failure** or **Security Breach** (detected by Hypervisor F12), the Sovereign may bypass the 72-hour window.
- **Condition:** Must be accompanied by a `RED_CODE_OEVRRIDE` entry in the ledger.
- **Audit:** A post-incident "Post-Phoenix" review must be performed within 24 hours of the bypass.

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** - Law is not given in a turn; it is forged in the cooling. 🏛️❄️⚖️
