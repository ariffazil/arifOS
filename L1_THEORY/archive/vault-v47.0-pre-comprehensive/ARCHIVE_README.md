## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

**Constitutional Floor:** F1 (Amanah) - Reversibility mandatory

The old files were comprehensive for v47.0, but the new files are SUPERSET:
- **Old:** 3×3 structure documentation (architecture only)
- **New:** Architecture + Philosophy + Literature Review + Implementation + Tests

**Content Preserved:**
- All information from 001/002/003 is included in AAA/BBB/CCC
- New files add 2025-2026 AI research grounding
- New files add epistemological foundations
- New files add constitutional philosophy
