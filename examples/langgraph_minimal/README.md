# LangGraph Minimal Example

This folder is a placeholder for a minimal LangGraph integration.

Intended pattern:

- Node 1: ARIF reasoning (Δ-engine)
- Node 2: ADAM safety / empathy (Ω-engine)
- Node 3: APEX PRIME review (Ψ-engine)

The file `graph.py` currently contains a stub.
You (or future collaborators) can replace it with a real LangGraph graph
that uses `arifos_core` functions to enforce floors and log Cooling Ledger entries.
