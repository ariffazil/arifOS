MALAY BASIN OVERVIEW
====================
Source: Petronas Annual Report 2023

The Malay Basin is Malaysia's most prolific hydrocarbon province, located
offshore Peninsular Malaysia in the South China Sea. The basin is a Tertiary
rift basin that has been producing oil and gas since 1978.

KEY STATISTICS
--------------
- Area: Approximately 80,000 km2
- Water Depth: 50-200 meters (predominantly shallow water)
- Proven Reserves: 3.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (as of 2023)
- Daily Production: ~350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
- Number of Fields: 65+ producing fields
- Platforms: 200+ offshore platforms

GEOLOGICAL SETTING
------------------
Primary reservoirs are found in Oligocene-Miocene sandstones at depths
ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. The main reservoir groups are:

- Group A-D (Shallow): 1,500-2,000m depth
- Group E-H (Medium): 2,000-2,800m depth
- Group I-K (Deep): 2,800-3,500m depth

SOURCE ROCKS
------------
Principal source rocks are lacustrine shales of Oligocene age, with
total organic carbon (TOC) values of 2-5%. Oil generation window
reached in the Miocene period.

PRODUCTION HISTORY
------------------
- 1978: First oil production (Tapis Field)
- 1985: Peak production phase begins
- 2000: Enhanced oil recovery programs initiated
- 2015: Deepwater exploration begins
- 2023: Continued production with mature field optimization

FUTURE PROSPECTS
----------------
Remaining undiscovered resources estimated at 1.5-2.5 billion barrels
of oil equivalent. Focus areas include:
- Deeper prospects below 4,000m
- Stratigraphic traps
- Enhanced recovery from mature fields
- Near-field exploration

UNCERTAINTY BAND
----------------
Reserve estimates carry an uncertainty of 15-20% due to:
- Limited well control in deeper intervals
- Reservoir heterogeneity
- Price volatility impact on economic reserves
