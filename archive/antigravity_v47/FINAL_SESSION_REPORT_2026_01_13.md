## 🏆 Achievements Unlocked

1.  **Constitutional Meta-Search (v46.1):**
    - Bridged `arifOS` internal governance (F1-F12) with external reality (Web Search).
    - Validated by 49 tests (passed).
    - "Partial Seal" established (11 `xfail` items in backlog).

2.  **Grand Unification EUREKA Ledger:**
    - Unified insights from **ALL** agents (Kimi, Claude, Antigravity) into one artifact.
    - Location: `L1_THEORY/knowledge/01_EUREKA_VAULT999_CONSTITUTIONAL_SYSTEM_v46.md`.
    - Key Learning: **"The map must verify the territory."**

3.  **Documentation Synchronization:**
    - `CHANGELOG.md` updated with v46.1.0 release.
    - `README.md` updated with new features.
    - `AGENTS.md` updated with "Tertib dan Flow" doctrine.
    - `CLAUDE.md` updated with "Partial Seal" wisdom.

## 🛑 Blockers Resolved

- **Trinity Seal Block:** Resolved by Human Sovereign override of unrelated legacy test failures.
- **Test Gaps:** Resolved by "Partial Seal" doctrine (82% coverage + transparency > 0% coverage).

## 🔮 Next Steps (The "Morning" Queue)

1.  **Phase 3 Backlog:** Implement the 11 `xfail` features in meta-search.
2.  **MCP Consolidation:** Review the stashed `arifos_mcp/` changes (deferred by Architect).
3.  **Legacy Test Fixes:** Address the 58 project-wide test failures (Track B) to unblock Trinity automations eventually.
