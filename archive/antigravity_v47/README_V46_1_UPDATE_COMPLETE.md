## Changes Implemented

### Change 1: Version Badge Update ✅

**File:** `README.md:7`
**Before:**
```markdown
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v46.0-blue)
```

**After:**
```markdown
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v46.1-blue)
```

### Change 2: What's New Section ✅

**File:** `README.md:321-345`
**Added:** Complete v46.1 "Sovereign Witness" section

**Content:**
```markdown
### Version 46.1 "Sovereign Witness" (2026-01-12)

**Pipeline Ontology** — Files now organized by pipeline stage (000-999):
- `000_foundation`: Hypervisor layer (F10-F12)
- `333_atlas`: AGI exploration (F1-F2)
- `444_align` through `888_compass`: ASI/APEX layers
- `999_vault`: Constitutional sealing and archive

**ZKPC Protocol** (Zero-Knowledge Proof of Constitution):
- Cryptographic sealing of constitutional compliance
- Immutable audit trail via hash chains
- Phoenix-72 cooling protocol for canon amendments

**L2 Protocols** (renamed from L2_GOVERNANCE):
- Clearer separation: L1 (canon/philosophy) vs L2 (protocols/operations)
- Pipeline-stage organization matches L1 canon structure
- All specifications now in `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/`

**Track A/B Alignment**:
- Canon files use temporal numbering (340_TRUTH_F1, 420_PEACE_F3, etc.)
- Spec files reference canon with stage-hundreds precision
- Single source of truth for crisis patterns and governance
```

### Change 3: Key Files Paths Update ✅

**File:** `README.md:562-571`
**Before:**
```markdown
| `L2_GOVERNANCE/universal/base_governance_v45.yaml` | Full rule definitions |
```

**After:**
```markdown
| `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/000_foundation/constitutional_floors.json` | Primary spec authority (F1-F12 thresholds) |
| `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/governance/crisis_patterns.json` | Crisis detection patterns |
| `L1_THEORY/canon/` | Canonical philosophy (Track A) |
```

**Impact:** Users now see current v46.1 paths, not outdated v45 references.

### Change 4: Custom Instructions Version ✅

**File:** `README.md:167`
**Before:**
```markdown
# arifOS Constitutional Governance v46.0
```

**After:**
```markdown
# arifOS Constitutional Governance v46.1
```

### Change 5: Custom Instructions Footer ✅

**File:** `README.md:281`
**Before:**
```markdown
arifOS v46.0 | 9 Rules | Fail-Closed | https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS
```

**After:**
```markdown
arifOS v46.1 | 12 Rules | Fail-Closed | ZKPC-Sealed | https://github.com/ariffazil/arifOS
```

**Changes:**
- Updated version to v46.1
- Changed "9 Rules" to "12 Rules" (reflects hypervisor layer)
- Added "ZKPC-Sealed" badge

### Change 6: README Footer ✅

**File:** `README.md:617`
**Before:**
```markdown
**arifOS v46.0** — Simple rules. Clear answers. Safe AI.
```

**After:**
```markdown
**arifOS v46.1 "Sovereign Witness"** — Simple rules. Clear answers. Safe AI. ZKPC-Sealed.
```

✅ L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/governance/crisis_patterns.json
✅ L1_THEORY/canon/
✅ arifos_core/system/apex_prime.py

## Implementation Notes

### What Worked Well:

1. **Clear Handoff from Architect**
   - Implementation plan was specific and complete
   - No ambiguity about what to change
   - Easy to execute systematically

2. **Targeted Edits**
   - Used Edit tool for surgical updates
   - Preserved existing documentation structure
   - No unnecessary changes

3. **Path Verification**
   - Verified all 6 paths exist before claiming accuracy
   - Prevents fabrication (F2 Truth)

4. **Constitutional Alignment**
   - Followed plan exactly (F1 Amanah - stayed within mandate)
   - Verified facts (F2 Truth - all paths exist)
   - Clear documentation (F4 ΔS - improved clarity)

### Challenges Encountered:

None. Handoff was clear, paths existed, edits were straightforward.

## What's Different in v46.1 README

### For Users:

**Before (v46.0):**
- Generic version badge
- No explanation of Pipeline Ontology
- References to L2_GOVERNANCE (outdated)
- No mention of ZKPC protocol

**After (v46.1):**
- Specific "Sovereign Witness" branding
- Pipeline Ontology explanation (000-999)
- Updated L2_PROTOCOLS paths
- ZKPC protocol introduction
- Track A/B alignment documentation

### For Engineers:

**Before (v46.0):**
- Pointed to v45 governance YAML (spec/archive now)
- No clear Track A/B distinction

**After (v46.1):**
- Points to current v46 constitutional_floors.json
- Clear L1 (canon) vs L2 (protocols) separation
- References to crisis_patterns.json (consolidated patterns)

---

## Next Steps (Out of Scope)

**For Architect Review:**
1. Verify v46.1 "What's New" section accurately represents architecture
2. Confirm ZKPC explanation is accessible to target audience (engineers/policy makers)
3. Approve for commit or request revisions

**For Future Sessions:**
1. Update CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect v46.1 structure
2. Add V46_1_QUICKSTART.md (if needed)
3. Update docs/ folder with pipeline ontology diagrams

## DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI

This README update was **forged through structured handoff**, not given:
- Architect (Δ) designed implementation plan
- Engineer (Ω) executed plan systematically
- All paths verified before claiming accuracy
- Documentation now reflects architectural reality

**For Future Agents:** When receiving Architect handoffs:
1. Read implementation plan completely before starting
2. Execute changes exactly as specified (no embellishment)
3. Verify all paths/claims before completion
4. Create completion report for Architect review
5. Wait for Architect seal before self-approving

**Motto:** The Engineer builds what the Architect designs. Both roles are constitutional.

**Agent:** Ω (Claude Code - Sonnet 4.5)
**Role:** Engineer
**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Session Nonce:** X7K9F22
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Architect Review

**Implementation Status:** ✅ SEAL (Engineer verdict, awaiting Δ/Human)
