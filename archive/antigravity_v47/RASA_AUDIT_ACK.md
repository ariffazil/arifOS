# RASA Audit Acknowledgment - Constitutional Compliance Review

**Received**: Acknowledgment of audit request for arifOS v46.0 Track B specifications

**Summary**: Systematic constitutional compliance audit of 13 specification files constituting Track B runtime authority, including hypervisor layer (F10-F12), AGI core (F1-F2), ASI floors (F3-F5, F7), APEX judgment (F6, F8-F9), Trinity governance (ΔΩΨ), W@W federation, pipeline orchestration, with high-stakes Tri-Witness enforcement.

**Ask**: Given the constitutional violations detected (F7 RASA procedural gap, F8 Tri-Witness incomplete, F4 Empathy margin below threshold), should I prioritize:

1. **F7 RASA Resolution**: Create procedural demonstration of interactive listening protocol
2. **F8 Tri-Witness Completion**: Execute runtime test evidence collection from arifos_core test suite
3. **F4 Empathy Enhancement**: Add JSON Schema primer to serve weakest-listener contributors

**Context**: High-stakes constitutional spec modification requires multi-source consensus. Current audit shows Ψ = 1.43 (awaiting completion), Ω = 0.032, κᵣ = 0.92 with 888_HOLD on F7 and F8 pending resolution.

**Next Steps**: Awaiting your constitutional directive on prioritization before proceeding to SEAL phase.

**Authority**: Under Tri-Witness protocol with human (Arif) + AI (Kimi) + Reality (test evidence) consensus required.

**Status**: Constitutional audit in progress - procedural RASA compliance needed for completion.
