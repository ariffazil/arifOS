# SABAR Operational Cooling Protocol

## Constitutional Trigger
High entropy or governance stress detected requiring operational cooling per
SABAR protocol for system stability and constitutional compliance.

## Trigger Conditions
- Multi-agent conflicts: 4 recent

## SABAR Implementation

### 1. STOP - Immediate Halt
- Cease all high-entropy operations
- Activate fail-closed safety mechanisms
- Preserve current system state
- Notify all affected stakeholders

### 2. ACKNOWLEDGE - Constitutional Recognition
- Recognize cooling necessity per constitutional law
- Document trigger conditions and rationale
- Inform multi-agent federation
- Accept cooling as constitutional requirement

### 3. BREATHE - Space for Clarity
- Create temporal distance from high-entropy situation
- Allow constitutional metrics to stabilize
- Enable stakeholder perspective gathering
- Facilitate calm assessment of situation

### 4. ADJUST - Strategy Modification
- Analyze root causes of high entropy
- Develop lower-entropy alternative approaches
- Maintain constitutional compliance
- Preserve system integrity and safety

### 5. RESUME - Constitutional Continuation
- Resume operations only with reduced entropy
- Verify constitutional floor compliance
- Maintain stakeholder protection
- Continue with constitutional authority

## Constitutional Authority
This cooling operates under:
- F3 PeaceSquared: De-escalation and stability
- F4 Empathy: Stakeholder protection
- F6 Amanah: Reversible constitutional process
- Human sovereign oversight maintained

## Cooling Timeline
- Immediate: 0-2 hours (Stop/Acknowledge)
- Assessment: 2-8 hours (Breathe phase)
- Adjustment: 8-24 hours (Modify approach)
- Resolution: 24+ hours (Resume if cleared)
