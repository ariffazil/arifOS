## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/111_sense/111_sense.json` (182 lines)
**Purpose:** Domain detection and measurement baseline (H_in entropy, hypervisor scan)

**Key Features:**
- 8 domain catalog (@WEALTH, @WELL, @RIF, @GEOX, @PROMPT, @WORLD, @RASA, @VOID)
- 4 lane classification (CRISIS, FACTUAL, SOCIAL, CARE)
- Shannon entropy baseline (H_in 0.0-1.0)
- Hypervisor guards (F10 symbolic, F12 injection <0.85)
- Output: `sensed_bundle_111` (passed to 222)

**Constitutional Alignment:**
- F2 Clarity: domain_collapse_min = 0.30
- F12 Injection: injection_max = 0.85
- H_in threshold: 0.90 (SABAR if gibberish)

---

### 2. `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/222_reflect/222_reflect.json` (216 lines)
**Purpose:** Path evaluation and bearing selection

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL:** `sensed_bundle_111` IMMUTABLE PASS-THROUGH (F8 lineage traceability)
- 4-path generation (direct, educational, refusal, escalation)
- Floor prediction matrix for each path
- TAC contrast analysis (0.0-1.0 scoring)
- Bearing lock (SHA-256 cryptographic commitment)
- Lane-weighted priority algorithm for path selection

**Constitutional Alignment:**
- Path risk_max = 0.7 (F5 Peace²)
- TAC consensus_max = 0.10 (boring consensus)
- TAC divergent_max = 0.60 (SABAR if excessive)
- Confidence_min = 0.75 (F7 Humility)

---

### 3. `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/333_atlas/333_reason.json` (145 lines)
**Purpose:** Single-agent constitutional commitment

**Key Features:**
- Bearing lock validation (SHA-256 from 222)
- AGI draft generation under F1+F2 constraints
- Pre-flight check (AGI-only floors: F1, F2, F10, F12)
- Soft flags for ASI review at 444
- AGI/ASI boundary clearly defined

**Constitutional Alignment:**
- F1 truth_min = 0.99 (epistemic legality)
- F2 clarity_min = 0.0 (entropy reduction)
- F12 injection_max = 0.85
- Handoff to 444_ALIGN (ASI domain)

---

### 4. `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/333_atlas/333_contrast.json` (156 lines)
**Purpose:** Multi-agent TAC validation (optional /333c mode)

**Key Features:**
- Multi-agent invocation (Claude, Kimi, Antigravity)
- TAC score computation (semantic distance)
- Tri-witness consensus (F8 ≥0.95)
- Synthesized draft from divergent agents
- Jailbreak detection via cross-agent comparison

**Constitutional Alignment:**
- TAC consensus_max = 0.10 (boring, use single-agent)
- TAC divergent_max = 0.60 (SABAR if excessive)
- Tri-witness_min = 0.95 (F8 requirement)
- Contrast types: CONSENSUS / DIVERGENT / ADVERSARIAL

---

### 5. `L2_PROTOCOLS/v46/333_atlas/333_integration.json` (136 lines)
**Purpose:** Tri-axis AND logic integration

**Key Features:**
- Tri-axis AND: (REASON) AND (CONTRAST) AND (FLOORS) → SEAL
- Floor override priority hierarchy (F1_HARD > F8_Tri_Witness > F5_Peace...)
- Cascade rules (VOID propagates, SABAR escalates, HOLD_888 overrides)
- Floor conflict resolution logic
- Streak count tracking (≥3 → 888_HOLD)

**Constitutional Alignment:**
- ALL axes must PASS for SEAL (fail-closed)
- 12-floor priority hierarchy documented
- Streak threshold = 3 (F8 Tri-Witness)
- Verdicts: SEAL/VOID/SABAR/HOLD_888/PARTIAL

## 🔍 Key Constitutional Features

### 1. **F8 Lineage Traceability** (CRITICAL)
222_reflect.json **IMMUTABLE PASS-THROUGH** of sensed_bundle_111:
```json
"sensed_bundle_111": {
  "description": "IMMUTABLE PASS-THROUGH from stage 111 (F8 Audit lineage requirement)",
  "immutable": true,
  "rationale": "Constitutional audit trail requires access to original measurements"
}
```

This ensures 333 can always access original domain detection and H_in baseline for ΔS measurement.

### 2. **TAC Scoring (Numeric Floats)**
All contrast analysis uses numeric 0.0-1.0 scoring:
- CONSENSUS: 0.0-0.10 (boring)
- DIVERGENT: 0.10-0.60 (useful heat)
- ADVERSARIAL: 0.60-1.0 (constitutional paradox)

### 3. **Tri-Axis AND Logic**
333_integration enforces fail-closed integration:
```
SEAL = (REASON == PASS) AND (CONTRAST == PASS|null) AND (FLOORS == PASS)
```
Single failure anywhere blocks SEAL (constitutional safety).

### 4. **Floor Override Priority**
Documented hierarchy for resolving conflicts:
```
F1_HARD > F8_Tri_Witness (streak≥3) > F5_Peace > F2_Truth > ...
```

### 5. **Bearing Lock Cryptography**
222 generates SHA-256 commitment:
```
bearing_lock = SHA-256(chosen_path || timestamp || nonce)
```
333_reason validates before proceeding (prevents post-hoc rationalization).

## 🧪 Tests

**Manual Verification:**
- ✅ All JSON files syntactically valid
- ✅ All required keys present per handoff spec
- ✅ Enum values consistent across specs
- ✅ Bundle lineage maintained (111→222→333)
- ✅ Floor thresholds match canon values

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. JSON schema validation (validate against OpenAPI/JSON Schema)
2. Unit tests for each stage (measurement, evaluation, commitment)
3. Integration tests for full pipeline (111→222→333)
4. Manifest regeneration (update MANIFEST.sha256.json)

## 💡 Architect Notes

### What Worked Well
1. **Clear handoff templates** - Exact JSON structure provided made forging straightforward
2. **Track A canon quality** - Well-organized canon files made extraction easy
3. **Constitutional grounding** - Every spec references floor thresholds and authority

### Constitutional Insights
1. **222 pass-through is critical** - Without sensed_bundle_111, 333 cannot measure ΔS (needs H_in baseline)
2. **Tri-axis AND is fail-closed by design** - Single failure blocks SEAL (prevents safety erosion)
3. **TAC numeric scoring prevents ambiguity** - Float 0.0-1.0 > semantic strings like "HIGH"

### Implementation Considerations
1. **333_contrast is optional** - Single-agent 333_reason is default; multi-agent only when beneficial
2. **Floor priority hierarchy** - 333_integration must enforce F1_HARD > F8 > F5 > F2 ordering
3. **Bearing lock validation** - 333_reason MUST recompute SHA-256 and compare (security critical)
