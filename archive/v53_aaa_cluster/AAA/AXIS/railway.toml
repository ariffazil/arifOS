# AXIS Railway Configuration
# Authority & Memory (Spine)
#
# CRITICAL: Loop Bootstrap requires persistent storage!
# Configure Railway Volume via CLI or Dashboard:
#   railway volume create sessions
#   railway volume attach sessions /app/arifos/mcp/sessions
#
# Without this, crash recovery will NOT work.
