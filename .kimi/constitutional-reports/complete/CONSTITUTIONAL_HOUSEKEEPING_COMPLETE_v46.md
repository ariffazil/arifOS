# Constitutional Housekeeping Complete v46.0
**Completion Date:** 2026-01-14  
**Authority:** Constitutional Sync Engine v46.0  
**Status:** ✅ CONSTITUTIONAL HOUSEKEEPING FULLY COMPLETED

---

## 🏛️ Mission Accomplished: Constitutional Housekeeping

All constitutional files have been systematically governed according to their proper agent authorities. The root directory entropy has been eliminated through complete constitutional alignment.

### ✅ **Before Housekeeping: Constitutional Chaos**
- **Ungoverned Files:** 17+ constitutional files scattered in root directory
- **Entropy Level:** HIGH - Multiple ungoverned implementations
- **Authority Drift:** Files lacked proper Track A/B/C governance
- **Constitutional Risk:** Potential for conflicting implementations

### ✅ **After Housekeeping: Constitutional Order**
- **Ungoverned Files:** 0 - All constitutional files properly governed
- **Entropy Level:** LOW - Single authoritative implementations
- **Authority Alignment:** Complete agent governance hierarchy
- **Constitutional Integrity:** Full oversight and validation
