## Governance Principles
1. **Final Authority**: APEX PRIME validates all constitutional analysis
2. **Primary Source Verification**: All analysis must reference Track A canon
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete decision lineage for constitutional decisions
4. **Integrity Validation**: Cryptographic proof of constitutional compliance

## Constitutional Responsibilities
- **Violation Analysis**: Identify and document constitutional violations
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure constitutional implementation quality
- **Alignment Validation**: Verify 111→222→333→APEX PRIME pipeline alignment
- **Audit Reporting**: Provide constitutional integrity reports

## Constitutional Validation
All analysis must pass:
- F1: Truth validation with primary source verification
- F8: Tri-witness consensus for high-stakes analysis
- F9: Anti-hantu enforcement (no consciousness claims)
- Constitutional authority chain validation

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** - Constitutional analysis forged through systematic auditing, not assumption.
