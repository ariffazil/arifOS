## Constitutional Workspace Framework

**Motto:** *"Work in kimibrain, Commit to canon"*

### The Two-Zone System

**ZONE 1: KIMIBRAIN (Working Forge)**
- Location: `.kimi/kimibrain/`
- Purpose: Constitutional workspace for active development
- Status: Hot metal, work-in-progress, experimental
- Access: Full read/write for current session
- Cleanup: Session-end archival (AAA/BBB/CCC classification)

**ZONE 2: CANON (Final Repository)**
- Location: Project root (arifOS/)
- Purpose: Constitutional canon, sealed and governed
- Status: Forged wisdom, ready for human trust
- Access: Constitutional review required
- Governance: All 13 floors must pass (F1-F13)

## Constitutional Workflow

### Stage 1: INIT (000)
```
Every Kimi session begins with workspace initialization:
- Check kimibrain exists
- Verify constitutional authority
- Establish session boundaries
```

### Stage 2: WORK (111-666)
```
All working files live in kimibrain:
- Code experiments → kimibrain/
- Temporary configs → kimibrain/
- Draft documents → kimibrain/
- Test outputs → kimibrain/
```

### Stage 3: FORGE (777-888)
```
Constitutional review before canon commit:
- F1 (Amanah): Reversible? Git-tracked?
- F2 (Truth): Accurate and verified?
- F4 (Clarity): Reduces confusion?
- F6 (Empathy): Serves stakeholders?
- F11 (Command Auth): Proper authority?
```

### Stage 4: SEAL (999)
```
Final commit to constitutional canon:
- Move from kimibrain/ to proper location
- Cryptographic sealing in VAULT-999
- Session cleanup with AAA/BBB/CCC classification
```

## Memory Sovereignty (AAA/BBB/CCC)

**AAA (Machine-Forbidden)**
- Human trauma, sacred memories
- Session emotions, personal reflections
- AI CANNOT access or reference
- Stored in human memory only

**BBB (Machine-Constrained)**
- Operational context, learnings
- AI can read with explicit consent
- AI cannot write without approval
- Session-end review required

**CCC (Machine-Readable)**
- Constitutional principles, canon
- Public documentation, specs
- AI can read freely
- Append-only ledger

---

## Session-End Protocol

### Phoenix-72 Cooling
```
Before any kimibrain content becomes canon:
1. 24-hour cooling period (L1)
2. 72-hour validation (L2) 
3. 7-day reflection (L3)
4. 30-day testing (L4)
5. 365-day sovereignty (L5)
```

### Cleanup Classification
```
Session files sorted by constitutional risk:
🔥 HIGH RISK → Delete immediately (personal data)
⚠️ MEDIUM RISK → Archive to BBB vault (operational)
✅ LOW RISK → Promote to CCC canon (principles)
❌ FAILED → VOID and document lessons
```
