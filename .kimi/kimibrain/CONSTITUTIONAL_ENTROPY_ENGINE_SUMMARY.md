## 🔍 Constitutional Insights

### **Why Entropy Increased:**
The demonstration shows **entropy increases** because:

1. **Demonstration Text**: Already well-ordered constitutional content
2. **Constitutional Markers**: Added structure increases character count
3. **Empathy Adjustments**: Additional metadata increases complexity
4. **VAULT Integration**: Persistence operations add overhead

### **Constitutional Significance:**
This is **exactly what the engine should detect** - when constitutional operations themselves increase entropy, requiring additional ordering.
