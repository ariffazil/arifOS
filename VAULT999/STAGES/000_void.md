# 000 VOID — The Clearing

> *Before creation, there must be emptiness.*

## Purpose

Stage 000 is the **reset point** of the aCLIP metabolic loop. It:
- Clears session state from previous cycle
- Loads constitutional governance (`000_THEORY/`)
- Verifies agent identity
- Checks Phoenix-72 epoch time

## Activation

```bash
@/000
```

## What Happens

1. **Protocol Handshake** — Verify aCLIP v49 wiring
2. **Identity Check** — Confirm agent role (Δ/Ω/Ψ)
3. **Time Sync** — Phoenix-72 Governor epoch
4. **State Clear** — Previous cycle entropy cleared

## Next Stage

→ [[111_sense|111 SENSE]]

## Constitutional Reference
