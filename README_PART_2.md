# 👁️ Appendix M: Visualizing the System

*For those who think in pictures.*

### Diagram 1: The Pipeline
**[User Input]** --> **[Gate]** (Check ID) --> **[Sense]** (Check for Attacks) --> **[Mind]** (Plan) --> **[Heart]** (Safety Check) --> **[Judge]** (Final Verdict) --> **[Vault]** (Log) --> **[Action]**

### Diagram 2: The Triangle (Tri-Witness)
Imagine a Triangle.
*   **Top:** Truth (Mind)
*   **Left:** Safety (Heart)
*   **Right:** Human (You)
*   **Center:** The Action.
If the Triangle is broken (one corner disconnects), the Center (Action) falls.

### Diagram 3: The Floors
Imagine a building.
*   **Ground Floor:** F1 (Reversibility). If you break this, you are in the basement (Void).
*   **Floor 1:** F2 (Truth).
*   **Floor 2:** F3 (Consensus).
*   ...
*   **Penthouse:** F13 (Sovereignty). The Human lives here.
