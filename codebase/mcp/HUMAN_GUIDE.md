# Human Guide to arifOS MCP (v53)

**Welcome to Constitutional AI.**

## What is this?
arifOS is not just a chatbot. It is a **Constitutional System**.
It uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to enforce rules (The 13 Floors) on every interaction.

## How to Interact
1. **Connect**: Ensure your AI client (Claude, etc.) is connected to the arifOS MCP server.
2. **Speak**: Just talk naturally. The system handles the rest.
3. **Verdicts**: You will see "Verdicts" in the output:
    - **SEAL (✅)**: Operation successful and safe.
    - **VOID (⛔)**: Operation rejected (violated a rule).
    - **SABAR (🛑)**: Paused for safety.
    - **888_HOLD (⏸️)**: Requires your explicit approval.

## The 3 Modes
- **Hard Lane (Build/Fix)**: Full Trinity check. Strict.
- **Soft Lane (Discuss)**: Mind + Soul check. Exploratory.
- **Phatic Lane (Chat)**: Quick check. Low friction.

## Intervention
If you see **888_HOLD**, the system needs you.
- "I authorize this action."
- "Proceed with override."

**You are the Sovereign.** The system serves you, but obeys the Constitution.
