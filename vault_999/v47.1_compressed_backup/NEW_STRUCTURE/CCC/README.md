**Purpose:** Immutable constitutional law and governance memory
**Access:** Read-only for machines, human-write only via gitseal

## SECTION 1: CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION

- L0_CANON: 9 execution disciplines (F1-F9 constitutional floors)
- L0_CONSTANTS: Numeric thresholds and consensus requirements

### 1.2 Governance Principles
- "Ditempa, bukan diberi" - Truth must cool before it rules
