## INSIGHT

Only trinity (AAA-BBB-CCC) can survive. Human sovereignty must govern machine law, with memory as the cooling layer between impulse and action.

---

## EUREKA TRIAD

### STRUCTURE (What Changed)
Three-layer governance: AAA (human) -> BBB (cooling) -> CCC (machine). No layer can be bypassed.

### TRUTH (What Is Constrained)
Machine law (CCC) cannot override human sovereignty (AAA). Cooling (BBB) is mandatory between hot insight and cold law.

### SCAR (What It Took / What It Prevents)
Built arifOS after seeing AI systems fail from lack of human governance. Cost: 2 years development. Prevents: Uncontrolled AI autonomy.

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** — Forged, not given; truth must cool before it rules.
