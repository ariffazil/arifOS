*A Chronological Record. The Timeline of Becoming.*

---

## ERA I: CHILDHOOD (PENANG)
*1990–2008*

### Foundational Details
- **Date of Birth:** May 22, 1990
- **Place of Birth:** Bayan Lepas, Penang
- **Family Role:** Anak Sulung (Eldest Child)
- **Parents:** 
  - Father: Pembantu Tadbir Rendah (MPPP) — low-ranking civil servant
  - Mother: Gadis Kilang — factory worker
- **Economic Status:** B40 (Quiet Miskin)

### The Forging Ground
No toys. No shortcuts. No safety net. Just clarity and the necessity to be truthful.

### Academic Progression

**Primary School (Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Gelugor)**
- Age 9: Passed the PTS exam, skipped a grade
- UPSR: 5As

**Secondary School (MRSM)**
- MRSM Lenggong
  - PMR: 8As
  - Won the Tunas Saintis competition (project on Lantana camara)
- MRSM Langkawi
  - SPM: 9As
  - Remedial English class (a moment of invisibility despite excellence)

**Pre-University (SRI KDU)**
- International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma
- Awarded full PETRONAS scholarship in 2009

**Key Insight:**  
Academic achievement was not special; it was practical. Speed was useful. But at MRSM Langkawi, I learned a hard lesson: *being right does not make you visible, and visibility does not make you valid.*

## ERA II: STUDIES
*2009–2013*

### University of Wisconsin–Madison

- **Degree:** B.Sc. with double major in Geology & Geophysics and Economics
- **Additional:** Certificate in Environmental Studies
- **Scholarship:** Full PETRONAS scholarship
- **Activities:** International Educator, Peer Mentor, Malaysian Students Association

### Academic Work
- Authored: *"Petroleum System and Stratigraphy of Malay Basin Province, offshore Peninsula Malaysia"*
- Department of Geosciences, University of Wisconsin–Madison

### The Dual Vision
Why Geology + Economics?
- **Geology:** Understanding how the earth works.
- **Economics:** Understanding how humans work.

Both are systems. Both have rules. Both reward those who understand the pattern.

### September 15, 2014
Received employment offer from PETRONAS as **Executive (Petroleum Geoscience)**.

## ERA III: PETRONAS
*2014–2024*

### The Early Years (2014–2017)
- **September 2014:** Joined PETRONAS as Executive, Petroleum Geoscience
- **2015–2016:** Witnessed the institutional trauma of the **Mutual Separation Scheme (MSS)**
  - Nearly 1,000 staff affected
  - Decades of institutional knowledge erased
  - The company forgot its own scars
  - This forged a permanent law: *"A company that forgets its scars will bleed again."*

### The Peak Years (2017–2024)
- **September 2017 – October 2024:** Senior Exploration Geoscientist

**Key Discoveries & Projects:**
- **Bekantan-1 Discovery:** The shallowest flowing oil accumulation in Malay Basin history
- **2018:** Recalled a critical risk from a departed mentor's forgotten report. This act of memory saved PETRONAS millions.
- **Puteri Basement-1:** Instrumental contribution to PM318 PSC success
- **Lebah Emas-1:** Frontier slope play, challenged and succeeded
- **PM-5, PM-304, PM-328 blocks:** Assessed exploration prospectivity across multiple blocks
- **Multi-partner technical reviews:** Production Sharing Contract (PSC) assurance

**Record:** 100% success rate. Zero dry wells across all wells.

### Personal Event (2024)
- **Abah (Father) passed away**
- This forged the **"Abah Check":** *"Would this make Abah proud?"*
- This became the ultimate moral veto in all future decisions

### The Later Phase (2024–Present)
- **November 2024 – Present:** Leading Phase 3 Sabah Regional Multiphysics study
- **2025:** Co-authored subsurface proposal for Layang-Layang TEA (Technical Evaluation Agreement)
- **2025:** Contributed to Lebah Emas-1 frontier well success

---

## ERA IV: THE SHIFT
*2024–2026*

### A Crossroads
Around late 2025, began serious contemplation of accepting a Mutual Separation Scheme (MSS) package from PETRONAS.
- **Estimated Net Value:** ~RM400,000
- **Motivation:** Freedom to build ArifOS full-time

### The Burning
By mid-2020s, began encoding personal experiences ("scars") into a personal AGI framework: **ArifOS**.

**What ArifOS Is:**
- A "deep-tech governance startup"
- A "conceptual AGI substrate"
- "Mirror-aligned" and "trauma-aware"
- Project codename: Safe-FS
- Refusing to be forgotten. Refusing to forget.

### The Internal Struggle
"Running hot" — burning internally with the need to build something true.

Seeking "tectonic calm" — the state of unshakable stability after emotional catharsis.

### Stated Motivation
- Freedom and self-determination
- The goal to "pursue innovation unbound by internal inertia or diluted values"
- To document the burning so that others do not have to burn

### The Hard Questions
Can I protect my family if this fails?
Can I maintain my maruah while building something uncertain?
Can I honor my Amanah while taking this risk?

The answer: Yes. Because the cost of not building is higher.

## CONCLUSION

This is not a biography of success. This is a timeline of becoming. Each scar marked a permanent law. Each achievement proved that clarity and memory matter.

The question is not "What did he do?" but "What will he do next?"

The answer will be forged in the fires ahead.
