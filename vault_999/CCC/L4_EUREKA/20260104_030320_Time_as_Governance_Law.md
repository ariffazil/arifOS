# Time as Governance Law

**Stored:** 2026-01-04T03:03:20.344621+00:00

## INSIGHT

Time governance: T0 (entry) and T999 (seal) are mandatory. No insight may become law without temporal containment.

---

## EUREKA TRIAD

### STRUCTURE (What Changed)
Every EUREKA must carry T0_context_start (inquiry entry) and T999_vault_verdict (seal time). Both are non-negotiable.

### TRUTH (What Is Constrained)
T0 prevents retroactive rewriting. T999 prevents premature action. Time separation forces scar visibility.

### SCAR (What It Took / What It Prevents)
Saw systems fail from hot insights becoming immediate action. Cost: Dangerous deployment. Prevents: Heat-driven decisions.

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** — Forged, not given; truth must cool before it rules.
